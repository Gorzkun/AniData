1;1;1;Cruelty;Tanjiro;Human;Male;How? How did this happen? Nezuko, don't die! Don't die on me! I'm gonna save you no matter what! I won't let you die! I swear your big brother will save you no matter what!
2;1;1;Cruelty;Kie Kamado;Human;Female;Tanjiro? Your face is covered in soot. Come over here. It's dangerous with all this snow. You don't have to go, you know.
3;1;1;Cruelty;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Well, I want everyone to eat their fill on New Year's, so I'm gonna sell as much charcoal as I can.
4;1;1;Cruelty;Kie Kamado;Human;Female;Thank you.
5;1;1;Cruelty;Shigeru Kamado;Human;Male;Big Bro! You're going to town again today?
6;1;1;Cruelty;Hanako Kamado;Human;Female;I'm going with you!
7;1;1;Cruelty;Kie Kamado;Human;Female;Oh no, you're not. You know you can't walk fast like Tanjiro.
8;1;1;Cruelty;Shigeru Kamado;Human;Male;Mom!
9;1;1;Cruelty;Kie Kamado;Human;Female;You may not. Since he can't use the cart today, he won't be able to give you a ride when you're tired.
10;1;1;Cruelty;Shigeru Kamado;Human;Male;Big Bro!
11;1;1;Cruelty;Hanako Kamado;Human;Female;I wanna go with you! I promise I'll help you!
12;1;1;Cruelty;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Thanks, Hanako. But you're staying home today. You, too, Shigeru. But I'll get you tons of goodies, okay?
13;1;1;Cruelty;Shigeru Kamado;Human;Male;Really?
14;1;1;Cruelty;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yeah. And Hanako, I'll read for you when I'm back.
15;1;1;Cruelty;Hanako Kamado;Human;Female;Okay!
16;1;1;Cruelty;Tanjiro;Human;Male;That's a good girl.
17;1;1;Cruelty;Kie Kamado;Human;Female;Thank you so much, Tanjiro.
18;1;1;Cruelty;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Sure. Okay, I'll be heading out now. Takeo... Will you chop as much wood as you can?
19;1;1;Cruelty;Takeo Kamado;Human;Male;Sure, I'll do it, but... I was hoping we could do it together.
20;1;1;Cruelty;Tanjiro;Human;Male;There, there.
21;1;1;Cruelty;Takeo Kamado;Human;Male;What's with that all of a sudden?
22;1;1;Cruelty;Shigeru Kamado;Human;Male;You're blushing, Take!
23;1;1;Cruelty;Takeo Kamado;Human;Male;Hey, you shut up!
24;1;1;Cruelty;Tanjiro;Human;Male;There, there.
25;1;1;Cruelty;Takeo Kamado;Human;Male;I said cut it out!
26;1;1;Cruelty;Hanako Kamado;Human;Female;Hurry back, okay? Be safe, okay?
27;1;1;Cruelty;Nezuko;Demon;Female;Big Brother!
28;1;1;Cruelty;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Hey, Nezuko.
29;1;1;Cruelty;Nezuko;Demon;Female;I was putting Rokuta down for a nap, or he'd make a scene when you leave. He misses Dad a lot after he passed away. And everyone follows you wherever you go. See you later!
30;1;1;Cruelty;Tanjiro;Human;Male;We don't have an easy life, but we're happy. But life could change suddenly like the weather. It shifts and moves on. It's not like it always stays sunny, and it's not like it ever snows endlessly. And... whenever happiness is destroyed, there's always... the smell of blood.
31;1;1;Cruelty;Old Lady 1;Human;Female;Well now, Tanjiro! I can't believe you came down from the mountain on a day like this. You're such a hard worker! You might catch a cold, you know?
32;1;1;Cruelty;Tanjiro;Human;Male;This is nothing, really. Do you have enough charcoal?
33;1;1;Cruelty;Old Man 1;Human;Male;Hey, Tanjiro! Can I have some charcoal? Thanks for fixing my sliding doors the other day.
34;1;1;Cruelty;Old Man 2;Human;Male;I'll need some charcoal, too!
35;1;1;Cruelty;Young Man 1;Human;Male;Tanjiro! Oh man, perfect timing! I've been accused of breaking this plate! Help me out, will you? Sniff it!
36;1;1;Cruelty;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I smell a cat.
37;1;1;Cruelty;Young Man 1;Human;Male;You see?
#N/A
39;1;1;Cruelty;Young Man 1;Human;Male;I told you it wasn't me!
40;1;1;Cruelty;Old Man 3;Human;Male;Tanjiro! Can you give me a hand with this luggage?
41;1;1;Cruelty;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Jeez, it's late already. I'm glad they're sold out, though.
42;1;1;Cruelty;Saburo;Human;Male;Hey, Tanjiro! Are you gonna go back to the mountain? You'd better not. It's too dangerous.
43;1;1;Cruelty;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I've got a great sense of smell, so I'll be fine.
44;1;1;Cruelty;Saburo;Human;Male;I'll put you up for the night. Come on. Get back here.
45;1;1;Cruelty;Tanjiro;Human;Male;But...
46;1;1;Cruelty;Saburo;Human;Male;Don't argue! Come on! Before the demons show up.
47;1;1;Cruelty;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Thanks for the meal! Hey, Granddad Saburo, what are demons like?
48;1;1;Cruelty;Saburo;Human;Male;Man-eating demons have always prowled the land once it gets dark. That's why you should never stroll around at night. If you're done eating, go to bed. You can set off for home at first light.
49;1;1;Cruelty;Tanjiro;Human;Male;These demons wouldn't come inside your house, would they?
50;1;1;Cruelty;Saburo;Human;Male;Yes, they'd come in.
51;1;1;Cruelty;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Then, everyone would get eaten up by the demons.
52;1;1;Cruelty;Saburo;Human;Male;That's why the demon hunters protect us by slaying them since way back when. Lights out now. Go to sleep.
53;1;1;Cruelty;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Old man Saburo is all alone after losing his whole family. So, he must be lonely. I'll bring my brothers and sisters next time, and say, "You don't have to be scared. There are no demons. You're safe." But, come to think of it, my grandma used to say the same thing when she was still alive.
54;1;1;Cruelty;Saburo;Human;Male;You be careful now.
55;1;1;Cruelty;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Okay! Whenever happiness is destroyed, there's always... The smell of blood! Nezuko! What happened? What's going on? What happened here? Mom... Mom... Hanako... Takeo... Shigeru... Nezuko... Rokuta... Nezuko's the only one who's still warm! If I can get her to a doctor, she might survive! How did this happen? Was it a bear? Was it a bear that wasn't able to hibernate? I can't breathe! The air's so icy! My lungs hurt! Keep moving forward! Move your legs faster! We still have a long way to go before we reach town. Hurry! I won't let you die! I'm gonna save you no matter what! I swear your big brother will save you no matter what! Oh no! I was saved by the snow. I slipped because of the snow to begin with. Nezuko? Nezuko, are you all right? You don't have to walk! I'll carry you to town, okay? Nezuko! Sh-She's... a demon! I just remembered what old man Saburo told me. Nezuko's a man-eating demon? No! Nezuko's a human ever since she was born! However, she no longer has Nezuko's scent. But it wasn't Nezuko's doing! She was lying as if she was protecting Rokuta, and there was no blood on her mouth or hands. And there was one more... There was one more scent! Sh-She just grew in size! And she's getting stronger and stronger! While I was sleeping carelessly at Saburo's house, they were murdered brutally like that! I know it must've hurt. You suffered, didn't you? I'm so sorry I couldn't save you. If only I could help Nezuko at least! But she's too strong for me to push her back! Nezuko! Hang in there, Nezuko! Don't give in! You gotta hang in there! Don't turn into a demon! You gotta stay strong! Hang in there! Hang in there! What the... Who's that? A sword?
56;1;1;Cruelty;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;Why are you protecting it?
57;1;1;Cruelty;Tanjiro;Human;Male;She's my sister! She's my younger sister! Nezuko!
58;1;1;Cruelty;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;You call that thing your sister?
59;1;1;Cruelty;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Nezuko!
60;1;1;Cruelty;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;Don't move! My job is to slay demons. Needless to say, I'm going to decapitate your sister.
61;1;1;Cruelty;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Hold on! Nezuko hasn't killed anyone! Back at my house, there was another scent that I'd never smelled before! That's probably the one who killed my family! It wasn't Nezuko! I don't know why she turned into something like that, but... but still...
62;1;1;Cruelty;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;It's quite simple. Because her wounds were exposed to demon blood, she turned into a demon. That's how man-eating demons multiply.
63;1;1;Cruelty;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Nezuko would never eat humans!
64;1;1;Cruelty;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;You gotta be kidding. Just now, you were about to be devoured.
65;1;1;Cruelty;Tanjiro;Human;Male;You're wrong! I'm sure she knows who I am! I won't let her hurt anyone! I'm going to turn Nezuko back into a human! I swear I'll heal her!
66;1;1;Cruelty;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;She can't be healed. Once you become a demon, you can never go back to being a human.
67;1;1;Cruelty;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'll find a way no matter what! So, please... So, please don't kill her! I'll hunt down the one who slaughtered my family! I'll make everything all right! Please! Please! Don't do it! Don't take anyone else from me. I'm begging you not to! Please! Don't kill my little sister! Please don't do it! I'm begging you...
68;1;1;Cruelty;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;Don't ever give others a chance to murder you! Stop that pathetic groveling! If it was the least bit effective, your family wouldn't be dead! Can a weakling who can't take the initiative in such a situation heal his sister?! Hunt down the enemy?! Don't make me laugh! The weak have no rights or choices! Their only fate is to be relentlessly crushed by the strong! The demons might know how to cure your sister! But don't think that a demon would respect your will or wishes! Naturally, I have no respect for you, either! That's reality! Why did you throw yourself over your sister earlier? Was that your way of protecting her? Why didn't you swing your hatchet? Why did you show your back to me? All those blunders led to your sister's capture! I could've skewered her along with you! Don't cry. Don't despair. Now's not the time for that. I know you're devastated. Your family was massacred, and your sister's become a demon. I know it's painful. I know you want to scream. I get it. If only I'd gotten here a half-day sooner, your family might not have ended up dead. But there's no way to turn back time. Feel the rage. The powerful, pure rage of not being able to forgive will become your unswerving drive to take action! With such a fragile resolve like yours, you can't protect your sister or heal her... or get revenge for your family!
69;1;1;Cruelty;Tanjiro;Human;Male;No! Stop!
70;1;1;Cruelty;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;A straightforward attack driven solely by emotion... You fool! Where's his hatchet? Just before he hid behind the tree, he hurled that rock toward me and, at the same time, tossed the hatchet in the air. He hid his hands as he pretended to attack so I wouldn't realize he was unarmed. He knew he couldn't beat me. He tried to bring me down after I struck him! This kid... Damn! She'll devour him!
71;1;1;Cruelty;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Nezuko... It wasn't Nezuko! She'd never eat humans!
72;1;1;Cruelty;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;Long ago, someone once said the same thing, only to be devoured by a demon. When a demon is starving, it will kill and devour even its own parents or siblings. Because they're nutrient-rich. I've seen it happen more times than I can count. This girl has been wounded, and she's expending energy to heal those injuries. She must've drained vast amounts of her strength as she transformed into a demon. That means she's severely starved at this moment, without a doubt. She must've wanted to feast on a human right away, even if it's her own brother... Yet, she protected him instead, and she even intimidated me... I wonder... These siblings might be... different from others.
73;1;1;Cruelty;Kie Kamado;Human;Female;I'm sorry to leave you behind, Tanjiro. Take care of Nezuko for me, all right?
74;1;1;Cruelty;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;You awake? Go see an old man named Sakonji Urokodaki who lives at the foot of Mt. Sagiri. Tell him that Giyu Tomioka sent you. She seems to be all right since it's cloudy now, but never let her be exposed to the sunlight, okay?
75;1;1;Cruelty;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Let's go.
76;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Excuse me. Would it be okay if I took that basket, straw and some bamboo?
77;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Young Man 2;Human;Male;Sure, you're welcome to it, but that basket's full of holes.
78;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yes. I'll pay you for it.
79;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Young Man 2;Human;Male;No, that's all right. I mean, it's a basket with holes.
80;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yes, I will pay you!
81;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Young Man 2;Human;Male;No, it's all right. You can have the bamboo and straw for free, too.
82;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Tanjiro;Human;Male;But I'm still paying you!
83;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Young Man 2;Human;Male;I said it's okay! You're one stubborn kid!
84;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Please accept this, although it's just small change! Thank you very much!
85;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Young Man 2;Human;Male;Ouch!
86;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Nezuko? Huh? Nezuko? She's gone! There she is. Nezuko... She dug a hole? My kid sister's turned into a mole. And she's frowning! She must really want to avoid the sunlight. Wait there for a second! Nezuko? Nezuko? Think you can fit inside this? I want to keep moving during the day, too. I'll carry you, okay? Can you fit? In here? Basket. She kinda protrudes, huh? I can't believe she grew up. Seems like yesterday that she was tiny. Nezuko? Remember how you became big like an adult earlier? Do you think you can do the opposite? Get smaller? Smaller, Nezuko! Get smaller! Good job! That's a good girl, Nezuko! I'm impressed!
87;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Young Lady 1;Human;Female;Mt. Sagiri? If you want to go to Mt. Sagiri, you'll have to cross over that mountain, but... The sun's about to set. Are you really heading there with all that luggage? It's dangerous, you know.
88;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'll be careful. Thank you very much.
89;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Young Lady 1;Human;Female;People have gone missing lately! Try not to lose your way!
90;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Tanjiro;Human;Male;There's a temple over there. There's light leaking through, so someone must be there. Let's check it out. I smell blood! This mountain path is pretty rough! Someone must've gotten hurt! Are you all right?
91;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Demon Mt Sagiri;Demon;Male;What the hell? This is my turf. If you break into my territory, I'll make you pay!
92;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Tanjiro;Human;Male;It's a man-eating demon!
93;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Demon Mt Sagiri;Demon;Male;There's something off about you. Are you both humans? A hatchet, huh? Not bad. But a scratch like this... should heal in no time. See that? The bleeding's stopped already.
94;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Tanjiro;Human;Male;He's so fast! And he's unbelievably strong!
95;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Demon Mt Sagiri;Demon;Male;You won't get me twice! All right. I'm gonna snap your neck!
96;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Sh-She killed him! Oh, but wait! He's a demon, so... N-Nezuko... I don't believe this! Did he just move without his head?!
97;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Demon Mt Sagiri;Demon;Male;You bastards! One of you is a demon after all? You gave off such a weird vibe! What's a human and a demon doing teaming up?
98;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Tanjiro;Human;Male;He's actually talking! Stop it! Nezuko! Nezuko! What's the deal with this guy? Growing arms from his head! I gotta save Nezuko! Out of my way!
99;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Demon Mt Sagiri;Demon;Male;Hard as a rock! That head of his... Like a rock!
100;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Okay!
101;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Demon Mt Sagiri;Demon;Male;I wrapped my hair around his hatchet to grab it, but it got tangled up! Dammit!
102;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Nezuko! Where are you? Nezuko! Stop it! I wonder if there are tons of demons out there. This isn't the scent that was lingering in my house. That was a different demon... But... I gotta finish him off... or he'll attack more people! So... I gotta do it! Do it!
103;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Urokodaki;Human;Male;You can't finish him off with that. A goblin mask!
104;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I didn't hear his footsteps! H-How can I finish him off?
105;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Urokodaki;Human;Male;Don't ask me! Can't you use your own head to figure that out?
106;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Tanjiro;Human;Male;If stabbing's no good, I'll have to crush his head! To crush his skull and smash it completely, I guess I'm going to have to pound him with this rock many times. I bet he's going to suffer. Isn't there anything I can use to kill him with one blow?
107;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Urokodaki;Human;Male;This kid isn't going to cut it. He's too kind and can't make decisions. He's facing a demon, yet the scent of kindness remains. He has empathy for even a demon. Giyu... He's never going to make it.
108;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Demon Mt Sagiri;Demon;Male;I blacked out. Is my body dead, then? I feel sick! You bastard, I'll kill you! I swear I'll devour you! Get over here! Dammit! I can't go to you, so you come to me!
109;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I faltered too long. Now the sun's coming up!
110;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Demon Mt Sagiri;Demon;Male;Hey, are you listening, brat? Hey, come here, you! Are you listening, you brat?
111;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Tanjiro;Human;Male;He's gone with that much sunlight?! No wonder Nezuko shrinks from it! Nezuko? Nezuko? Nezuko... O-Oh, that's right. Where's that man? He buried the people who got killed. Um...
112;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Urokodaki;Human;Male;I'm Sakonji Urokodaki. I'm assuming you're the one Giyu Tomioka sent my way.
113;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yes! My name is Tanjiro Kamado! My sister's name is Nezuko, and...
114;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Urokodaki;Human;Male;Tanjiro... What will you do when your sister devours a human? Too slow! You're just too slow at making decisions! You failed to finish off that demon before daybreak! Do you know why you couldn't answer my question right away? It's because your resolve is too weak! There are two things to do if your sister devours a human. Kill your sister! And slit your own belly and die! That's what it means to travel with your sister who became a demon! But that must never happen no matter what. And you'd best not forget. Your sister, taking the life of an innocent person... That's the one thing that must never happen. Ever! Do you understand what I'm saying?
115;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yes!
116;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Urokodaki;Human;Male;All right, now I'm going to test you to see if you're fit to become a member of the Demon Slayer Corps. Carry your sister on your back and follow me!
117;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Tanjiro;Human;Male;He's so fast! Just how old is he anyway? And, like earlier, I'm not hearing any footsteps at all! Nezuko, I know it must be jarring, but please be patient! Well, being patient is all that you've ever known. Nezuko... All your life... You're fixing your kimono again? I guess we'll have to buy you a new one.
118;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Nezuko;Demon;Female;No, no, it's all right! This kimono's my favorite! I'd rather the younger kids got more food to fill them up!
119;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I swear I'll turn you back into a human! I swear I'll buy you a beautiful kimono someday! Everything that I couldn't do for the others... I'll do it all for you! N-Now, have I... passed the test?
120;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Urokodaki;Human;Male;The test starts now. We're going to climb a mountain. I'll make sure to take care of your sister for you.
121;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'm counting on you, sir. I'm so exhausted. My legs are starting to buckle! I'm starting to feel dizzy, too.
122;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Urokodaki;Human;Male;Now, from here, go back down to the house at the foot of the mountain. This time, I'm not going to wait until daybreak!
123;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Is that all? I see. He thinks I might get lost in this thick fog. I just have to get back by daybreak, right? That's easy! I've got a great sense of smell! I've already memorized Mr. Urokodaki's scent! Rocks?! A pitfall? I get it now. So, there are traps all around! That's the deal, huh? Uh-oh! Crap, crap, crap! If I keep walking into traps like this, I won't make it down the mountain by morning! And besides, this mountain... This mountain is... The air's thin here! It's way thinner here than on the mountain where I used to live! That's why I'm gasping for air like this and feel so dizzy! Will I make it back? I might pass out! No! I gotta make it back! Get your breathing under control... and sniff out each of those traps! Right! I've got it! I've got it! Traps set by human hands have a slightly different smell after all! But that doesn't mean... I'm suddenly athletic enough to dodge every one of them! I'm gonna make it back no matter what! Nezuko! I... have... returned.
124;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;Forgive my abruptness, Mr. Sakonji Urokodaki. I'm sending a boy your way who wants to become a Demon Slayer swordsman. He was brazen enough to attack me unarmed. His family was slaughtered by a demon, and the surviving younger sister has become one, but I have determined that she will not attack humans. I can sense something different about these two. Like yourself, the boy seems to have a keen sense of smell. Perhaps he'll find a way to break through and become your heir apparent. I am asking you to train him. I realize that this is a self-serving request, but please forgive me. I hope that you will take good care of yourself in your endeavors. Yours truly... Giyu Tomioka.
125;1;2;Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki;Urokodaki;Human;Male;I accept you as my student, Tanjiro Kamado.
126;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;JOURNAL Tanjiro Kamado
127;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Urokodaki;Human;Male;Let's go. The Demon Slayer Corps has around several hundred members. It's an organization unrecognized by the government. Yet it's existed since ancient times, and we continue to hunt demons today. But as for who's leading the Demon Slayer Corps, that remains a mystery. Demons. Staple food... Humans! They kill humans and feed on them. No one knows when and where they first appeared. Their physical prowess is remarkable. Wounds heal in the blink of an eye. Flesh is restored after being hacked off, and limbs can be newly regenerated. Some demons can shape-shift. Others have otherworldly powers. They can only be killed by sunlight or by decapitation with a special sword. The Demon Slayers battle the demons with their own mortal bodies. Since they're human, their wounds are slow to heal, and, once lost, their limbs don't grow back! Even so, they battle the demons... to protect other humans. I am a trainer. I literally train swordsmen. There are many trainers, and each of them trains their pupils with their own regimen in their location. To join the Demon Slayer Corps, you must survive the Final Selection process held on Mt. Fujikasane. Whether or not you're eligible for Final Selection is up to me.
128;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Starting today, I'm going to keep a journal for Nezuko. I'm descending the mountain again today. I'm going to train my hardest so I won't die during Final Selection. After repeatedly descending the mountain, day after day, I'm starting to learn how to avoid most of the traps. It's because I'm much stronger now, and because I'm even more adept at detecting scents than before. Even so... the traps are getting more and more difficult. He may really want to kill me! I made my descent today, sword in hand, but the sword really hampered my movement. With the sword, I can't stop getting ensnared in all the traps! 991! I swing the sword today. Well, it's not just today. I've been swinging the sword every single day. After descending the mountain, I swing my sword until my arms nearly fall off. 1,000!
129;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Urokodaki;Human;Male;500 more!
130;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Swords break easily. That's what he told me beforehand. Though it's strong vertically, it's weak horizontally, so... you need to apply the force straight along the blade. The blade's direction and the direction in which you apply the force must be exactly the same. And he added, "If you ever damage the blade, in other words, break it, I'll snap your bones, as well" in a threatening tone of voice. Nezuko... I'll keep working hard, okay? Today, I did nothing but fall. Training to break my fall and get up quickly from any position. I wield my sword, and I charge Mr. Urokodaki really trying to kill him. In contrast, Mr. Urokodaki is bare-handed and unarmed. But he's ridiculously powerful! He flings me away to roll on the ground every time. I'm home, Nezuko. Today, I learned breathing techniques and some forms. Total Concentration Breathing?
131;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Urokodaki;Human;Male;That's right. And I'm going to teach you all ten of the Water Breathing forms. Remember to take a long breath so the oxygen flows into every cell in your body. This will enhance your body's natural healing power, and both stabilize and energize your spirit. Relax your upper body while bracing your lower half. All right, breathe! Wrong! Next! Forms!
132;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Right! Like this?
133;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Urokodaki;Human;Male;Wrong!
134;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Like this?
135;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Urokodaki;Human;Male;Wrong!
136;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;This?
137;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Urokodaki;Human;Male;Wrong!
138;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;This?
139;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Urokodaki;Human;Male;Wrong!
140;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I get yelled at for not bracing my stomach and clobbered to a pulp. Next, he told me to become one with the water.
141;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Urokodaki;Human;Male;Get in there!
142;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Nezuko! Nezuko! I am water! And now it's been six months since Nezuko was last awake. Mr. Urokodaki summoned the doctor right away and had him examine her, but he found nothing wrong. But it's not normal for her to stay asleep like this. I was scared. I worry that one morning, I'll wake up to find her dead. Not a day goes by that I don't worry. My descents are getting more dangerous, and the air's even thinner where I train. Time and time again, I think I might die.
143;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Urokodaki;Human;Male;I have nothing more to teach you.
144;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;A year after I arrived at Mt. Sagiri, he told me all of a sudden...
145;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Urokodaki;Human;Male;The rest is up to you! Whether or not you can improve to the next level. Come with me! If you can slice this boulder, I will allow you to enter Final Selection.
146;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Is a boulder... something you slice? Something you can slice with a sword? I don't think I can do it. My sword will snap! Mr. Urokodaki, please wait! Mr. Urokodaki! After that, Mr. Urokodaki never taught me anything again. Every day, I practiced over and over what I'd learned from Mr. Urokodaki. The basics like holding the breath and flexibility... I was glad I had written those down in my journal. But... even after six months had passed, I still couldn't slice the boulder. I felt frustrated. Not enough! I wasn't training hard enough! I gotta do more! More! Am I... hopeless? Is Nezuko going to die without ever waking up? I'll almost give in! I'm breaking down!! Keep working, Tanjiro! You can do it!!
147;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Sabito;Human;Male;Shut up! A man shouldn't whine. It's unseemly.
148;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;When did he show up? There's no scent. A fox mask?
149;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Sabito;Human;Male;Now matter how you suffer, bear it in silence... if you're a man. If you call yourself a man. Slow. Weak. Immature. That's not what you call a man.
150;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;What are you doing?
151;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Sabito;Human;Male;I'd like to know what you think you're doing.
152;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;What do you mean? I'm training.
153;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Sabito;Human;Male;How long do you plan to keep your butt on the ground without even taking a stance? Come on. Come at me.
154;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;But you have a wooden sword, and I have a real sword!
155;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Sabito;Human;Male;Well, well! Thank you for worrying about me. So, you think you're actually going to injure me! Well, you have absolutely nothing to worry about! I'm more powerful than you because I've sliced that boulder!
156;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;He's sliced that boulder?
157;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Sabito;Human;Male;You've learned nothing. You haven't mastered a single thing! Particularly, the breathing technique Mr. Urokodaki taught you... Total Concentration Breathing.
158;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;He knows Mr. Urokodaki? And the breathing technique, too?
159;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Sabito;Human;Male;All you did was memorize it as fact. Your body has no clue what it needs to do. What the hell were you doing for a whole year and a half? Slam it into your flesh! More! More! More! So that you'll never forget the secrets Mr. Urokodaki taught you! Pound it into the marrow of your bones!
160;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'm trying! I'm trying every single day! With everything I've got! But I'm not making any headway! I just can't go any further!
161;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Sabito;Human;Male;Go further! If you're a man! If you call yourself a man! There's no other way to go but forward! Bring it on! Show me what you're capable of! I'm leaving the rest to you.
162;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Makomo;Human;Female;Are you all right?
163;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Did you see that just now? What a strike that was! Not a single bit of wasted motion! It was really beautiful! I want to become like that! You think I can become like him?
164;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Makomo;Human;Female;I'm sure you can... since I'll be looking after you.
165;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;She's so cute. Who are you? This girl's name was Makomo. She told me the boy's name was Sabito. Makomo also pointed out my defects. She corrected my unnecessary movements and bad habits. But when I asked her why she was doing that, and where she came from, she didn't tell me anything.
166;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Makomo;Human;Female;Both he and I love Mr. Urokodaki very much.
167;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;That was Makomo's pet phrase. She and Sabito weren't siblings. She said Mr. Urokodaki raised them after they'd been orphaned.
168;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Makomo;Human;Female;There are other children besides us. They're always watching you, Tanjiro.
169;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Makomo is a somewhat strange girl. She speaks in such an abstract, dreamy way.
170;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Makomo;Human;Female;See, Total Concentration Breathing accelerates your blood circulation and your heart rate. That causes your body temperature to spike, making you as strong as a demon while staying human. The important thing is to expand your lung capacity. When you bring lots of air into your blood, and when your blood gets excited, your bones and muscles scurry to heat up and grow stronger.
171;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'm not sure I get that. How can I do that?
172;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Makomo;Human;Female;Train to death. At the end of the day, there's nothing else you can do.
173;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Until my arms and legs were ready to fall off... Until my lungs and heart were ready to burst, I swung my sword. But still... I just couldn't beat Sabito. Not until six months later. When I challenged him that day, Sabito was wielding a real sword.
174;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Sabito;Human;Male;After six months, finally, you have the look of a man.
175;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Today's the day I win! Head-on battles are simple. Whoever's stronger and faster wins. The battle was over in an instant. On this day, in this moment, for the first time, my blade reached Sabito first. The moment I won, Sabito smiled. He looked sad and happy. A relieved kind of smile.
176;1;3;Sabito and Makomo;Makomo;Human;Female;Tanjiro... You did great. Don't forget what you just did. Win, okay, Tanjiro? Beat that guy, too.
177;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;The reason I won... was because I learned to detect the scent of the opening thread. When I'm battling someone, and I pick up this scent, then I can see the thread. The thread is connected from my blade to my opponent's opening, growing taut the instant I see it. My blade is drawn toward it with great force, and then I slash the opening. Mr. Urokodaki...
178;1;4;Final Selection;Urokodaki;Human;Male;I had no intention of sending you to Final Selection. I didn't want to see children die anymore. I was sure you wouldn't be able to slice this boulder, but... Well done, my boy! Tanjiro, you're... a remarkable kid! Make sure you come back alive from Final Selection. Both your sister and I will be waiting for you here.
179;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;What's the occasion? There's so much.
180;1;4;Final Selection;Urokodaki;Human;Male;You've completed all your training, so we're celebrating. Don't be shy. Eat up.
181;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Thank you very much!
182;1;4;Final Selection;Urokodaki;Human;Male;Tanjiro, there's nothing more I can do for you. From here on out, you'll be going through such hardship and strife. Your training will seem like nothing in comparison. So, for now, at least, you should rest well without a care in the world. Hey, Tanjiro...
183;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yes?
184;1;4;Final Selection;Urokodaki;Human;Male;Did you enjoy that hot pot?
185;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yes! I haven't had such a feast in so long!
186;1;4;Final Selection;Urokodaki;Human;Male;A growing boy like you with a hearty appetite should get stronger the more he eats, as well as grow bigger in size. But that goes for demons, too. Remember this. Basically, a demon is as strong as the number of humans he's devoured.
187;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;So, the more they eat, the stronger they get?
188;1;4;Final Selection;Urokodaki;Human;Male;That's right. There are demons who gain power, become able to transform their bodies, and even use strange spells. When your sense of smell becomes keener, you'll be able to tell how many humans a demon's consumed.
189;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;What's this?
190;1;4;Final Selection;Urokodaki;Human;Male;It's called a "warding mask." I've charged it with a spell to protect you from harm.
191;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Warding mask... Nezuko... I'm coming back here no matter what, all right?
192;1;4;Final Selection;Urokodaki;Human;Male;Don't worry about your sister. I'll take good care of her.
193;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;All right! Thank you very much! I'll be going, then, Mr. Urokodaki! Say hello to Sabito and Makomo for me!
194;1;4;Final Selection;Urokodaki;Human;Male;Tanjiro... How do you... know the names of those dead children?
195;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Wow. Look at all these wisteria flowers. Even though they're out of season... There are so many.
196;1;4;Final Selection;Gemelas;Human;Female;- Everyone... - Everyone... - ...we thank you for coming here tonight. - ...we thank you for coming here tonight. - To the Demon Slayers Corps Final Selection. - To the Demon Slayers Corps Final Selection. There are demons imprisoned here on Mt. Fujikasane, captured alive by the Demon Slayer swordsmen, and unable to leave. That is because wisteria, which demons hate so much, blooms year-round from the bottom to halfway up the mountain. However, there is no wisteria from this point on, and so demons abound. You'll need to survive here for seven days to pass Final Selection. - And now, be on your way. - And now, be on your way.
197;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Survive for seven days... That's all I'm going to think about. First, I'm going to survive tonight. Once the sun comes up, the demons won't be able to do anything, so I can get some rest then. So, I'll have to head east! I'm gonna make my way to where the sunlight will hit first! This smell... It's a demon! And it's nearby! Where is it? Where's it coming from? I can't pinpoint the direction of the scent! From above? Demon...
198;1;4;Final Selection;Demon Final Selection 1;Demon;Male;Damn you!
199;1;4;Final Selection;Demon Final Selection 2;Demon;Male;Don't even try to grab my prey, man!
200;1;4;Final Selection;Demon Final Selection 1;Demon;Male;Get off my turf, dammit!
201;1;4;Final Selection;Demon Final Selection 2;Demon;Male;The hell with you! Just beat it!
202;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Two of them right from the get-go? I wonder if I can take them!
203;1;4;Final Selection;Demon Final Selection 1;Demon;Male;That's my prey, you know!
204;1;4;Final Selection;Demon Final Selection 2;Demon;Male;Shut up!
205;1;4;Final Selection;Demon Final Selection 1;Demon;Male;It's first come, first served!
206;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'm okay! Just calm down and watch their movements! Remember the training!
207;1;4;Final Selection;Demon Final Selection 2;Demon;Male;It's been ages since I last had human flesh!
208;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Total Concentration! Water Breathing! The scent of the thread! Fourth Form! Striking Tide! I did it! I defeated demons! I've grown stronger! All that training wasn't for nothing! I've mastered it! If I slash a demon with the sword Mr. Urokodaki gave me, not even the bones are left behind, huh?
209;1;4;Final Selection;Urokodaki;Human;Male;A demon's weak spot is its neck! But you can't kill it with a normal sword even if you slash its neck.
210;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Then, how can I take it down?
211;1;4;Final Selection;Urokodaki;Human;Male;The swords wielded by the Demon Slayer Corps were forged with a special kind of steel. That's the only way to kill a demon. They're called the "Nichirin Swords."
212;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Rest in peace. What's this rotten smell?
213;1;4;Final Selection;Boy Final Selection;Human;Male;No one ever told me! I never signed up for this!
214;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;What's going on? What the hell is that?
215;1;4;Final Selection;Makomo;Human;Female;Hey, Sabito... Do you think Tanjiro can beat that one?
216;1;4;Final Selection;Sabito;Human;Male;I don't know. No matter how hard you try, it's never enough. You know that well yourself, don't you?
217;1;4;Final Selection;Boy Final Selection;Human;Male;What's this morphed demon doing here anyway? They didn't tell us!
218;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;He got eaten! Don't wimp out! Save him! Save him! Save him! I'm not powerless anymore! Move! Water Breathing, Second Form! Water Wheel!
219;1;4;Final Selection;Morphed Demon Final Selection;Demon;Male;Another sweet little fox has come to me.
220;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Another?
221;1;4;Final Selection;Morphed Demon Final Selection;Demon;Male;Little fox cub, what is the year of Meiji now?
222;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;It's the Taisho Period now!
223;1;4;Final Selection;Morphed Demon Final Selection;Demon;Male;Taisho? Holy crap!! Time has passed into a new period?! Again! Again while I've been held prisoner inside this place! Unforgivable! Unforgivable! Damn you, Urokodaki! Damn you, Urokodaki! Damn you, Urokodaki! Damn you, Urokodaki!
224;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;How do you know Mr. Urokodaki?
225;1;4;Final Selection;Morphed Demon Final Selection;Demon;Male;I know him, all right! Because Urokodaki is the one who captured me! I'll never forget that day 47 years ago! Back when he was still hunting demons! It was the Edo Period during the Keio Era.
226;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Hunting demons? Edo Period?
227;1;4;Final Selection;Boy Final Selection;Human;Male;You're lying! No demon has ever lived that long! The only demons in here should be the ones who've eaten just two or three humans! They don't live long because they're killed during Final Selection, and they even eat their own kind!
228;1;4;Final Selection;Morphed Demon Final Selection;Demon;Male;Yeah, but I've survived all this time. Inside this wisteria prison, I've eaten at least fifty of you brats.
229;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Fifty?
230;1;4;Final Selection;Morphed Demon Final Selection;Demon;Male;11, 12... 13. That makes you Number 14!
231;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;What are you talking about?
232;1;4;Final Selection;Morphed Demon Final Selection;Demon;Male;The number of Urokodaki's disciples I've eaten, that's what. I promised myself to kill every one of his disciples. Let's see... The ones who particularly stand out to me... It's those two. Those two... That brat's hair was an unusual color. He was the most powerful. He had pinkish hair. A scar by his mouth. The other one was a female brat in a flowery kimono. She was small and lacking in power, but she was awfully agile.
233;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;They had already been killed by this demon?! But I was with them!
234;1;4;Final Selection;Morphed Demon Final Selection;Demon;Male;That mask. I can tell by the fox masks. I know the texture of the masks Urokodaki carved. The same style of carving he used for his own goblin mask. Warding masks, right? Everyone got eaten just because they were wearing them. They're all here inside my belly. Urokodaki might as well have killed them himself! When I said that to the girl, she was crying and fell into a rage. And right after that, she lost control of her movements. I ripped off her limbs, and then...
235;1;4;Final Selection;Sabito;Human;Male;Calm down, Tanjiro. Your breathing's uneven. It's all right. Never mind us!
236;1;4;Final Selection;Boy Final Selection;Human;Male;I'm getting out of here while the demon's taking out that guy!
237;1;4;Final Selection;Morphed Demon Final Selection;Demon;Male;Another of Urokodaki's brats is dying. I wonder how he's gonna feel when another of his kids doesn't come home. I wonder what kind of look he'll have on his face. Oh man, I wish I could see it. I really do.
238;1;4;Final Selection;Shigeru Kamado;Human;Male;Big Bro! Big Bro!
239;1;4;Final Selection;Morphed Demon Final Selection;Demon;Male;He dodged it! So, he can still move? Great! I can have some fun!
240;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Damn! No matter how many arms I cut, they grow back in a second!
241;1;4;Final Selection;Morphed Demon Final Selection;Demon;Male;You can't defeat me just by slashing off my arms. Then again, even that pink-haired brat couldn't slice off my head!
242;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I can't just let this one go! Before any more lives are sacrificed, I gotta bring him down now! A demon's scent coming from the ground?
243;1;4;Final Selection;Morphed Demon Final Selection;Demon;Male;H-He jumped! Dammit, I missed him! Yeah, but no way can he dodge this attack in mid-air!
244;1;4;Final Selection;Makomo;Human;Female;Do you think Tanjiro's going to lose, too? His neck is so tough after all.
245;1;4;Final Selection;Sabito;Human;Male;He may lose, and yet, he may win. Either way, there's one irrefutable fact. That Tanjiro... is the man who sliced the toughest, largest boulder of all.
246;1;4;Final Selection;Morphed Demon Final Selection;Demon;Male;He deflected me!
247;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Total Concentration! Water Breathing!
248;1;4;Final Selection;Morphed Demon Final Selection;Demon;Male;He got too close to me! Not to worry. My neck is tough! He can't slash it!
249;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;First Form!
250;1;4;Final Selection;Morphed Demon Final Selection;Demon;Male;As soon as he fails to cut my neck, I'm going to crush his head! Just like I did to the other one!
251;1;4;Final Selection;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Water Surface Slash!
252;1;5;My Own Steel;Morphed Demon Final Selection;Demon;Male;That mask. I can tell by the fox masks. Everyone got eaten just because they were wearing them.
253;1;5;My Own Steel;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Total Concentration! Water Breathing! First Form! Water Surface Slash!
254;1;5;My Own Steel;Morphed Demon Final Selection;Demon;Male;Urokodaki! Dammit! Dammit! Dammit! My body's crumbling and disappearing. I can't stop it! Dammit! To think that the face of a Demon Hunter will be the last thing I'll ever see... How did it come to this? I'm so scared. I'm all alone. Brother, where are you? I want you to hold my hand! Like you always do! Why? Why on earth did I bite you to death, Big Brother? Huh? Wait, who's this "Brother" person?
255;1;5;My Own Steel;Tanjiro;Human;Male;What a sad scent. God... Please... The next time this man is reborn, please make sure he doesn't turn into a demon.
256;1;5;My Own Steel;Morphed Demon Final Selection;Demon;Male;Brother! Brother! Brother! Hold my hand, will you?
257;1;5;My Own Steel;Morphen Demon Brother;Demon;Male;You're hopeless, you know? Still such a scaredy-cat.
258;1;5;My Own Steel;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Sabito, Makomo... and everyone else who were killed... I won. You can rest easy now. I guess you're going home as promised. Even though you're just souls, you're going back to Mt. Sagiri... ...and to Mr. Urokodaki whom you love very much. If I'd ended up dead, my soul would've returned there, too. There's something I wanna ask you! How do I turn someone who's become a demon back into a human? Please tell me! How can I turn Nezuko... back into a human? Wisteria? I made it. Only four of us? But there were at least twenty. I don't see that guy here, either. It's all because I blacked out at that moment. I couldn't save him.
259;1;5;My Own Steel;Zenitsu;Human;Male;I'm gonna die. I'm a goner. Even if I survive now, I'm gonna die in the end anyway.
260;1;5;My Own Steel;Gemelas;Human;Female;- Welcome back. - Welcome back. Congratulations. We're pleased to see that you're safe.
#N/A
262;1;5;My Own Steel;Gemelas;Human;Female;First, we shall issue you all uniforms. We will take your measurements, after which your rank will be engraved. There are ten ranks in all... Kinoe. Kinoto. Hinoe. Hinoto. Tsuchinoe. Tsuchinoto. Kanoe. Kanoto. Mizunoe... ...and Mizunoto. Currently, you are at the lowest rank, Mizunoto.
#N/A
264;1;5;My Own Steel;Gemelas;Human;Female;Today, we will let you choose the ore for your swords. However, the swords will take ten to fifteen days to complete.
#N/A
266;1;5;My Own Steel;Gemelas;Human;Female;But first... We will now assign each of you your own Kasugai Crow.
267;1;5;My Own Steel;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Kasugai Crow?
268;1;5;My Own Steel;Gemelas;Human;Female;These Kasugai Crows can be used primarily for communication.
269;1;5;My Own Steel;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Did you say "crow"? Isn't this a sparrow, though?
#N/A
271;1;5;My Own Steel;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Take your hand off her! Or else I'll break your arm!
#N/A
273;1;5;My Own Steel;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Wh-Wh-Wh-What should I do?
#N/A
275;1;5;My Own Steel;Gemelas;Human;Female;Are you finished chatting? Now then, please select an ore. The steel for the sword... that will annihilate demons and protect you... will be of your own choosing.
276;1;5;My Own Steel;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Well, not that I'm going to live very long. Probably.
277;1;5;My Own Steel;Tanjiro;Human;Male;They're asking us to choose, but how are we supposed to pick one out? I've never seen an ore before, and I can't tell the difference anyway.
#N/A
279;1;5;My Own Steel;Master Ubuyashiki;Human;Male;I see. As many as five of them managed to survive, huh? Excellent. The number of my children has increased again. I wonder what kinds of swordsmen they'll become.
280;1;5;My Own Steel;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I was so naive. I couldn't even have a talk with a demon. All they did was attack me and try to kill me right away. Sorry, Nezuko. I never got to ask them... how to turn a demon back into a human. Even my uniform is heavy. I wanna get home as soon as possible, but my whole body hurts. I made it. Nezuko... Mr. Urokodaki... Hey! Nezuko! You... So, you're awake? Nezuko! Why... Why'd you fall asleep all of a sudden? Never waking up once! I was worried you were going to die, you know?!
281;1;5;My Own Steel;Urokodaki;Human;Male;You came back to us alive. I see. You killed that morphed demon.
282;1;5;My Own Steel;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yes.
283;1;5;My Own Steel;Urokodaki;Human;Male;At last. I'm truly impressed that you made it back.
284;1;5;My Own Steel;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yes.
285;1;5;My Own Steel;Urokodaki;Human;Male;There are several kinds of demons. The demons who use a special spell called the "Blood Demon Art" possess supernatural abilities. You may have to fight those demons, as well, from now on. And battling them will be far more difficult than anything you've known until now. Even so, Tanjiro, I'm sure you'll be fine.
286;1;5;My Own Steel;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Right. Um... I think that Nezuko's not like the other demons. Do you think it could it be that Whatchamacallit Art?
287;1;5;My Own Steel;Urokodaki;Human;Male;No, I don't think so. I wouldn't call that an example of the Blood Demon Art. I'm just guessing here, but it could be that Nezuko's recovering her strength by sleeping instead of consuming human flesh.
288;1;5;My Own Steel;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'll protect you, Nezuko.
289;1;5;My Own Steel;Haganezuka;Human;Male;Uh... My name is Haganezuka. I have forged Tanjiro Kamado's sword, and I am here to deliver it.
290;1;5;My Own Steel;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Um, I'm Tanjiro Kamado. Please come inside.
291;1;5;My Own Steel;Haganezuka;Human;Male;This is the Nichirin Sword. And I forged it.
292;1;5;My Own Steel;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Um... Please come in so I can serve you some teâ€”
293;1;5;My Own Steel;Haganezuka;Human;Male;The materials for a Nichirin Sword can be obtained from the mountain closest to the sun. Scarlet Crimson Iron Sand and Scarlet Crimson Ore. These produce steel that can absorb sunlight.
294;1;5;My Own Steel;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Wow, is that right?
295;1;5;My Own Steel;Haganezuka;Human;Male;Mt. Yoko is bathed in sunlight all day long, you see. Never a cloud in the sky, nor any rain.
296;1;5;My Own Steel;Urokodaki;Human;Male;There he goes again,
297;1;5;My Own Steel;Tanjiro;Human;Male;You're going to get dirty, so could you get up for a second?
298;1;5;My Own Steel;Urokodaki;Human;Male;never listening to what others say...
299;1;5;My Own Steel;Tanjiro;Human;Male;A clown mask?
300;1;5;My Own Steel;Haganezuka;Human;Male;Hey, you're a Child of Brightness, aren't you? Now that's what I call lucky.
301;1;5;My Own Steel;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Oh no, I'm the son of Tanjuro and Kie.
302;1;5;My Own Steel;Haganezuka;Human;Male;That's not what I meant. See how your hair and eyes are a reddish color? When a kid like you is born into a family that works with fire, it's considered lucky and a cause for celebration.
303;1;5;My Own Steel;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Is that right? I had no idea.
304;1;5;My Own Steel;Haganezuka;Human;Male;There's a good chance that this sword will turn red! Right, Urokodaki?
305;1;5;My Own Steel;Urokodaki;Human;Male;Yeah.
306;1;5;My Own Steel;Haganezuka;Human;Male;Come on, hurry up and draw it! Nichirin Swords are also known as "Color Changing Swords." They change color depending on the bearer. Black!
307;1;5;My Own Steel;Urokodaki;Human;Male;It's black, huh?
308;1;5;My Own Steel;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Is it bad or something if it turns black? Is it unlucky?
309;1;5;My Own Steel;Urokodaki;Human;Male;No, not necessarily. But you don't see this pitch black too often.
310;1;5;My Own Steel;Haganezuka;Human;Male;And I was so hoping I'd get to see a bright red sword! Dammit!
311;1;5;My Own Steel;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Ouch! Stop! Please calm down! How old do you think you are?!
312;1;5;My Own Steel;Haganezuka;Human;Male;I'm thirty-seven!
313;1;5;My Own Steel;Crow;Bird;Bird;Tanjiro Kamado! Here are your orders!
314;1;5;My Own Steel;Tanjiro;Human;Male;It talks!
315;1;5;My Own Steel;Crow;Bird;Bird;Make your way to a town to the northwest! Young girls have been vanishing there! Night after night, young girls have been vanishing! Hunt down the demon lurking there and kill it! Tanjiro Kamado, prepare yourself well for this task! This is your first assignment as a Demon Hunter!
316;1;5;My Own Steel;Tanjiro;Human;Male;My first... assignment...
317;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Urokodaki;Human;Male;Have you gotten changed?
318;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yes.
319;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Urokodaki;Human;Male;Tanjiro... Now that you're starting out with the Demon Slayer Corps, I'd like to explain a few things to you.
320;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Right.
321;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Urokodaki;Human;Male;That Demon Slayer Corps outfit you're wearing right now... It's made of a special kind of fiber. The fabric is quite breathable, yet it repels moisture and won't burn easily. A low-level demon's talons or fangs couldn't even manage to tear that uniform.
322;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;It's that strong?
323;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Urokodaki;Human;Male;Also, that Nichirin Sword of yours... The color varies from owner to owner, and each hue has unique properties. But since not many people end up with black blades, little is known about them. So little, in fact, thatâ€”
324;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;So little is known that... What, Mr. Urokodaki?
325;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Urokodaki;Human;Male;Since so little is known about them, black blades are said to be wielded by swordsmen who'll never go far.
326;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I don't know how I'll do in the Demon Slayer Corps, but I'm going to turn Nezuko back into a human no matter what.
327;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Urokodaki;Human;Male;Yes, you're right. I have faith that you're going to make that happen.
328;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Right.
329;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Urokodaki;Human;Male;One more thing. Take this. It's a box for you to carry your sister in during the day. Built out of an extremely light wood called "Cloud Mist Pine." I coated it with rock lacquer to reinforce its exterior and to make it even more durable.
330;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Thank you very much! It's so light! It's really light, Mr. Urokodaki! Nezuko! Get inside this, will you? Can you do it? Nezuko, from now on, we're always gonna be together, okay? All right, I'll be going now.
331;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Urokodaki;Human;Male;Hold on. Do you mind?
332;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Nezuko, are you all right? Nezuko?
333;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Urokodaki;Human;Male;I'm just guessing here, but it could be that Nezuko's recovering her strength by sleeping instead of consuming human flesh.
334;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Nezuko... You get lots of rest. Could this be the town to the northwest?
335;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Young Lady 2;Human;Female;Oh, look, there's Kazumi. Poor thing. He looks so haggard.
336;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Young Lady 3;Human;Female;Because he was with Satoko when she was taken.
337;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Young Man 3;Human;Male;Night after night... It's so creepy.
338;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Young Lady 3;Human;Female;It's so dreadful!
339;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Young Lady 2;Human;Female;When night falls, yet another young girl will be abducted!
340;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Mr. Kazumi! If you don't mind, I'd like to hear your story. Is that all right?
341;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Kazumi;Human;Male;This is where Satoko vanished. You may not believe me.
342;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I do believe you! I believe you, all right! I believe you! There's still a faint trace of demon scent, but it's uneven, so to speak. There's something strange about this.
343;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Kazumi;Human;Male;Who is this kid anyway?
344;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Sakoto's Father;Human;Male;How dare you! What do you mean, "vanished"? You bastard!
345;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Sakoto's Mother;Human;Female;Dear! That's enough! Please stop!
346;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Kazumi;Human;Male;I want you to believe me. She really did vanish.
347;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I believe you. After all, that's why I'm here.
348;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Kazumi;Human;Male;You're gonna keep going?
349;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yes.
350;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Kazumi;Human;Male;Look how late it's gotten. I'm flattered that you're so concerned for me, but shouldn't you pick up again tomorrow and get some rest?
351;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Those things are active during the night. So, I can't afford to rest. I've detected a new scent in this area. It's gotta be somewhere nearby.
352;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Kazumi;Human;Male;Those things... Don't tell me you're... You're seriously...
353;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Girl 1 Mother;Human;Female;How terrifying. I want you to stay indoors for the time being.
354;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Girl 1;Human;Female;Yes, Mother. Now then, good night. I wonder what became of the girls who were taken. I just hope they're all right.
355;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Kazumi;Human;Male;What's gotten into you all of a sudden? So fast!
356;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;The scent just got stronger! The demon's at large!
357;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Kazumi;Human;Male;He jumped? He spoke of demons. The Demon Slayer Corps... He really...
358;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;This is it. They're here right now! Two different scents. A demon and a female human! They're nowhere to be seen. But... The spot where the scent is strongest... is right here! A morphed demon!
359;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Urokodaki;Human;Male;The demons who use a special spell called the "Blood Demon Art" possess supernatural abilities. You may have to fight those demons, as well, from now on.
360;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Where are those girls you kidnapped? I've got two more questions for you!
361;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Kazumi;Human;Male;Who was that?
362;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Mr. Kazumi, Please hold this person and stand nearby. If you're inside my range of attack, I can protect you! From the ground or this wall... It can probably emerge from anywhere. There's also the chance that it could show up out of thin air. But this demon... Even when it's submerged, it can't erase its scent! Here it comes! Water Breathing, Fifth Form! There's three of them! Settle down! You can do it! Eighth Form... Waterfall Basin!
363;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Urokodaki;Human;Male;Tanjiro, listen to me closely. The type of demon with the blood that can turn humans into demons... There's only one in this world.
364;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Just one...
365;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Urokodaki;Human;Male;The one who was the first to become a demon more than a thousand years ago. In other words, that is your family's foe. Moreover, I believe he's the one... who might know how to turn your sister back into a human. That demon's name is... ...Muzan Kibutsuji!
366;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Eighth Form, Waterfall Basin! Too shallow! I missed all the vulnerable spots! Because I switched forms midway through! All three of them have the exact same scent. I was told that demons don't band together as a rule. So, one demon has dispersed into three. I'm going to protect these two while slashing those three demons! Don't lose your nerve! Make sure you get him to tell you... about Muzan Kibutsuji... and how to turn a demon back into a human! Total Concentration... Water Breathing... Second Form... Water Wheel! Too shallow again! I can't chase him too far. And I can't take a full swing while guarding others!
367;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Swamp Demon 1;Demon;Male;You bastard! Back off for crying out loud! That girl's gonna go stale on me, dammit! That girl's already 16, okay? If I don't devour her soon, she's gonna lose flavor by the second!
368;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Swamp Demon 2;Demon;Male;Calm down, my other self. Hey, so what? There are gonna be nights like this. I've already fed on plenty of 16-year-old girls in this town. They were all quite meaty and delicious. I'm satisfied.
369;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Swamp Demon 1;Demon;Male;Well, I'm not satisfied, my other self! I wanna consume more!
370;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Kazumi;Human;Male;You monster... Return Satoko to me. The one you abducted the night before last!
371;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Swamp Demon 2;Demon;Male;Satoko? Who are you talking about? If her hairpin is among these collectibles, then I've devoured her.
372;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I missed again! He can escape underground so fast! Oh no! I got too close to the wall!
373;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Swamp Demon 2;Demon;Male;Why would a mere human be accompanying a demon? What's the meaning of this? Who are those two? Are they a swordsman and demon working together? I don't get it at all.
374;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Nezuko...
375;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Urokodaki;Human;Male;This may only be cold comfort, but while Nezuko was asleep, I used hypnotic suggestion on her.
376;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Suggestion?
377;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Urokodaki;Human;Male;All humans are your family. Protect humans. The demons are the enemy!
378;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Nezuko!
379;1;6;Swordsman Accompanying a Demon;Urokodaki;Human;Male;Never forgive any demon who brings harm onto humans"!
380;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Nezuko! Don't chase after him! Get back here! Come to me. Nezuko! Mr. Urokodaki did tell me... that Nezuko is a demon now. And that she's not necessarily so weak that I have to protect her. Is it all right to let her handle this? If I have her watch over those two, I can focus on my attacks. Nezuko! Nezuko! I'm going underground! I want you to protect those two! You can do that, right? Inside a swamp... And these are... Are these the clothes and belongings of the people who were kidnapped? Just look at all the innocent people they've murdered! It's unforgivable! Unforgivable!
381;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Swamp Demon 2;Demon;Male;Getting hard to breathe, brat? There's hardly any air inside this swamp. On top of that, the darkness coiling around your body must feel pretty heavy. You can't move the way you would aboveground! Serves you right! You should've looked before you leaped in, you damn fool!
382;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Don't underestimate me! Just where do you think I got my training anyway? The air was thinner on top of Mt. Sagiri! Not to mention... there are moves that only unleash their full potential underwater! So, they can move at angles like that inside this swamp? But it doesn't matter! All I have to do is slash when they get near enough to attack! The form that can be utilized even when there's no sure footing... Generating a powerful vortex with a violent twist of my upper and lower body! Here comes the scent! The opening thread! Total Concentration! Water Breathing! Sixth Form! Whirlpool! I can't breathe! I gotta get out of here! Nezuko!
383;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Swamp Demon 1;Demon;Male;This girl is powerful! She doesn't seem to have mastered any morphing skills yet, but look how strong she is anyway! She must have gotten a huge amount of blood from him! She moves so fast! I can't dive back into the swamp! But hey, I'm getting used to these one-note attacks of hers! Even if she kicks my head clean off... Even if my internal organs explode, demons can regenerate in a flash! All right! Now I'm gonna drill a hole right through your face!
384;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Hands off my sister!
385;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Swamp Demon 1;Demon;Male;Did I just get taken out? Both of my other selves got taken out by this guy!
386;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Tanjiro;Human;Male;You give off a scent like rotten oil. It's a horrible smell! How many people have you killed?
387;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Swamp Demon 1;Demon;Male;Listen! If women live any longer, they turn ugly and start tasting like crap! So, we killed them for their own good! You should be thankful to us demonsâ€”
388;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Never mind. You're going to tell me what you know about Muzan Kibutsuji. Talk to me! Start talking!
389;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Swamp Demon 1;Demon;Male;I-I can't tell you. I can't tell you! I can't tell you! I can't tell you!
390;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Muzan;Demon;N/a;You mustn't tell. You mustn't tell anyone about me. If you do tell anyone, I'll know right away. I'm always watching you.
391;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Swamp Demon 1;Demon;Male;I can't tell you! I can't tell you! I can't tell you! I can't tell you! I can't tell you!
392;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Tanjiro;Human;Male;The smell of fear is strong. He's trembling all the way down to his bones!
393;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Swamp Demon 1;Demon;Male;I can't tell you, all right?
394;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Once again, I failed to get any information. Nezuko! She's asleep. She stopped bleeding, too. So, she's sleeping in order to recover? Sorry. I'm so sorry. Wait just a little longer, okay? I promise to turn you back into a human again! Mr. Kazumi? Are you all right?
395;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Kazumi;Human;Male;I've lost my fiancÃ©e. How can I be all right?
396;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Mr. Kazumi... No matter how many people you may lose, you have no choice but to go on living. No matter how devastating the blows may be.
397;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Kazumi;Human;Male;What do you know about it? A kid like you?
398;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'll be on my way now. Take this. I hope you'll find something of Miss Satoko's in there.
399;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Kazumi;Human;Male;So, you went through the same thing, too? Is that it? I... I'm sorry! That was an awful thing to say! Please forgive me! I'm so sorry! His hand was heart-breaking to see. Hardened by relentless training and so thick. It wasn't a boy's hand.
400;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'm leaving that young woman in your hands!
401;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Kazumi;Human;Male;All right! All right!
402;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Tanjiro;Human;Male;It's not just me. How many people have you killed, tortured and tormented? Muzan Kibutsuji, I'll never forgive you as long as I live!
403;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Crow;Bird;Bird;Next up, Asakusa, Tokyo! Rumors of a demon lurking there!
404;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'm heading to my next mission already?
405;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Crow;Bird;Bird;Oh yes, you are!
406;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Hold on a minute.
407;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Crow;Bird;Bird;No can do!
408;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Come on, just give me a minute! Hold on! What?
409;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Crow;Bird;Bird;Just shut up and go already!
410;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Are the cities this advanced now? It's nighttime, but it's so bright out! The buildings are so tall! What is this? The cities... The cities... I feel dizzy. Uh, let's go that way, Nezuko! I-I beg your pardon! Excuse me. A bowl of udon with grated yam on top please.
411;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Udon Shopkeeper;Human;Male;Uh, sure thing!
412;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I've never been to a place like this. It's way too crowded.
413;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Udon Shopkeeper;Human;Male;Here's your udon with grated yam on top!
414;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Thank you very much. This scent! Why would I catch it here all of a sudden? It's the same scent that was left in my house! Muzan Kibutsuji! Is this the guy giving off that scent? It's him!
415;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Muzan's Daughter;Human;Female;Daddy? Who's that?
416;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Tanjiro;Human;Male;He's...
417;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Muzan's Daughter;Human;Female;It's all right.
418;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Tanjiro;Human;Male;He's...
419;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Muzan's Daughter;Human;Female;Don't worry.
420;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Tanjiro;Human;Male;He's... He's living here, pretending to be a human!
421;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Muzan;Demon;N/a;Is there something I can do for you? You seem to be quite flustered.
422;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Muzan's Wife;Human;Female;Oh my. What's going on?
423;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Muzan's Daughter;Human;Female;Mother!
424;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Tanjiro;Human;Male;They're humans! The girl and the woman... Their scent is human! Don't you know? Can't you tell? That this guy is a demon? That he devours humans?
425;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Muzan's Wife;Human;Female;Do you know him?
426;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Muzan;Demon;N/a;No. Much to my consternation, I've never seen this child before. He must have mistaken me for someone else.
427;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Muzan's Wife;Human;Female;Oh, you think so?
428;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Young Lady 4;Human;Female;Dear, what's the matter? Dear?
429;1;7;Muzan Kibutsuji;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Stop!
430;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Young Lady 4;Human;Female;Dear, what's the matter? Dear?
431;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Stop!
432;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Crowd;Human;N/a;What's this? What's going on? I-Is that blood?
433;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Stop it!
434;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Young Lady 4;Human;Female;Dear!
435;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Ma'am! You need to worry about yourself! Please take a cloth and press down hard on the wound! It's all right. Somehow, it's going to turn out fine. The wife's wound isn't fatal! Do it harder! Do it harder! Tie it up with a rope! It's going to be all right. This man hasn't killed anyone! Just a second ago, this man was just walking down this street!
436;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Muzan;Demon;N/a;Are you all right? You mustn't look. It's dangerous here, Rei. Let's move over there.
437;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Where'd he go? Dammit! Dammit! I can't leave this man here! Muzan Kibutsuji! I'm not letting you get away! No matter where you go!
438;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Muzan's Wife;Human;Female;What's the matter with that child? What do you think, Tsukihiko?
439;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;No matter where you go, you're not getting away! I'll follow you to the ends of Hell, and I swear I'll slice off your head with my blade! I'll never forgive you no matter what!
440;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Police 1;Human;Male;What the hell are you doing? Is it a drunk?
441;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Police 2;Human;Male;Kid, step away from that man!
442;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I can't! Bring some restraints please! Please!
443;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Police 2;Human;Male;Shut up and step away!
444;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Please don't do that! No one can hold this person down but me!
445;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Police 1;Human;Male;Move!
446;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Please don't do that!
447;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Police 1;Human;Male;Just look at this guy's face! Has he lost his mind?
448;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Police 2;Human;Male;Pull the kid off him!
449;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Please stop! I don't want this person to kill anyone! Just stay out of my way, will you? I'm begging you!
450;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Police 1;Human;Male;Dammit! Look, you... If you're going to keep resisting...
451;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tamayo;Demon;Female;Enchanting Blood. Aroma of Visual Fantasy.
452;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;What's this scent?
453;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Police 1;Human;Male;What are all these patterns? What's going on? I can't see anything!
454;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Is this some kind of attack? If it is, that means trouble! Is the scent growing stronger?
455;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tamayo;Demon;Female;You still use... the term "person"... to refer to even a transformed demon. And you're trying to save him. Allow me, then, to lend you a hand.
456;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;But why? You... Your scent tells me...
457;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tamayo;Demon;Female;That's right. I am... ...a demon, but I am also a doctor, and I wish to annihilate that man, Kibutsuji.
458;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Muzan's Daughter;Human;Female;Aren't you coming, Daddy?
459;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Muzan;Demon;N/a;Daddy has work. I have a business meeting to attend. I'm also concerned about that disturbance just now.
460;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Muzan's Wife;Human;Female;Dear...
461;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Muzan;Demon;N/a;Don't worry. I'm only going to speak with the police. Now, get in.
462;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Muzan's Daughter;Human;Female;Daddy, come home soon, okay?
463;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Muzan;Demon;N/a;All right. You be a good girl now. Take them back to the house. Go on.
464;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Young Man Drunk 1;Human;Male;Big Bro, let's hit one more bar!
465;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Young Lady Drunk 1;Human;Female;Yacchan, are you okay?
466;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Young Man Drunk 1;Human;Male;I'm fine! I'm fine! I'm not even drunk yetâ€” What the hell, you bastard?
467;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Muzan;Demon;N/a;Forgive me.
468;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Young Man Drunk 1;Human;Male;Hey, come back here!
469;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Muzan;Demon;N/a;I'm very sorry, but I happen to be in a hurry, so...
470;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Young Man Drunk 1;Human;Male;What did you say? Hey, look at you, decked out in those posh-looking threads! You piss me off! You and your pale face... You look like you're about to fall over dead! Hey, say something, will you? Or did you just croak?
471;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Young Lady Drunk 1;Human;Female;Yacchan!
472;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Young Man Drunk 2;Human;Male;What did you do to my kid brother?
473;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Young Lady Drunk 1;Human;Female;Yacchan! He's dead! Yacchan's not breathing!
474;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Young Man Drunk 2;Human;Male;You bastard!
475;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Muzan;Demon;N/a;Does my complexion look unhealthy to you? Is my face pale? Do I look sickly to you? Do I look like I'm not long for this world? Do I look like I'm about to die? Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. I'm a living being who's infinitely close to perfection. What do you think will happen if I keep flooding you with my blood? The human body is unable to withstand the speed of transformation. And its cells are destroyed. Bring me the head of the Demon Slayer who wears hanafuda-like earrings. Understood?
476;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Yahaba (Arrow Demon);Demon;Male;As you wish.
477;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;Your wish is our command.
478;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Muzan;Demon;N/a;Those earrings...
479;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Udon Shopkeeper;Human;Male;Now, listen to me! Here's the deal... My point is this, okay? It's not about the money! What I can't forgive is your lack of intent to eat my udon, all right?
480;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'm so sorry! Please serve me another bowl!
481;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Udon Shopkeeper;Human;Male;So, you're gonna eat it?
482;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yes!
483;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Udon Shopkeeper;Human;Male;You're definitely gonna eat it?
484;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yes, I shall!
485;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Udon Shopkeeper;Human;Male;Okay! You, too! If you're gonna have udon, take off that bamboo thingie first! What is that thing anyway? Take these chopsticks! Chopsticks!
486;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'd like a bowl of udon! I'd like two bowls of udon!
487;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Udon Shopkeeper;Human;Male;R-Right.
488;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Thank you very much for the meal! That was delicious!
489;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Udon Shopkeeper;Human;Male;As long as you get it! It's all good! Thanks for your business!
490;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Sorry about that, Nezuko. Leaving you behind like that... What's wrong, Nezuko? So, you've been waiting for us?
491;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Because I was told to bring you to see her.
492;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I could've tracked you by scent.
493;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Yushiro;Demon;Male;She's in a place that's under a cloaking spell. No way could you find it.
494;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Cloaking?
495;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Anyway... Isn't that woman a demon? And an eyesore to boot.
496;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Eyesore? Eyesore? Does he mean "ugly"? Who? Nezuko? Who in their right mind would call her an eyesore? Just take a good look at her features! She was the beauty of our hometown! Our Nezuko!
497;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Let's go.
498;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Sure, we'll go, but still... No way is she an eyesore! Not on your life! Take a look at her where there's a bit more light! Come on, let's go over there! Oh, I know what it is! It's this muzzle, right? It might be because of this muzzle! I'd like you to behold Nezuko without the muzzle!
499;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Hurry it up. While no one's around.
500;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;There's a house behind the dead end!
501;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Get over here! Listen. Make sure you don't offend that person in any way. Personally, I couldn't care less what happens to you. But I brought you here because she insisted!
502;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;R-Right.
503;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tamayo;Demon;Female;Come in.
504;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Yushiro;Demon;Male;I have returned.
505;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tamayo;Demon;Female;Welcome back.
506;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'm sorry that I left you to take care of things just now. How is the lady?
507;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tamayo;Demon;Female;She'll be just fine. Unfortunately, I have to keep her husband restrained in the basement.
508;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Isn't treating human wounds unbearable for you?
509;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Yushiro;Demon;Male;You think demons treat humans while choking back their own drool at the smell of blood?
510;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Sorry.
511;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tamayo;Demon;Female;Stop it. Why would you resort to violence? I never introduced myself, did I? My name is Tamayo. That boy is Yushiro. I hope that you'll be his friend.
512;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I don't think that's gonna happen.
513;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tamayo;Demon;Female;It's not unbearable, you know. I believe it's much easier for me than for normal demons. Because I've tweaked my body considerably. I've also removed Kibutsuji's curse.
514;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Curse? T-Tweaked your body?
515;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tamayo;Demon;Female;Come this way.
516;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Hey, Nezuko, that's bad manners!
517;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tamayo;Demon;Female;That's quite all right. Please make yourselves at home.
518;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Sorry.
519;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tamayo;Demon;Female;Now then, allow me to continue. I adjusted our bodies so that we can live without devouring humans. A small amount of human blood is all we need.
520;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Blood? You mean...
521;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tamayo;Demon;Female;You may find it distasteful, but what I do is buy blood under the guise of transfusions from those unable to make ends meet. Of course, no more than would impair them.
522;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I see. So, that's why I'm not picking up that strange scent unique to demons from these two. But they do need human blood after all. If blood is all they need, then Nezuko...
523;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tamayo;Demon;Female;Yushiro can get by with even less blood. I'm the one who turned him into a demon.
524;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;You did that? But...
525;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tamayo;Demon;Female;You're right. It's generally held that no one but Kibutsuji can reproduce demons. That's more or less accurate. After more than 200 years, I was only able to transform Yushiro into a demon after all.
526;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Two... Two hundred years... You were only able to transform Yushiro after more than 200 years?
527;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tamayo;Demon;Female;Exactly how old are you, Miss Tamayo?
528;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Don't ask a lady her age, you ill-mannered scoundrel!
529;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tamayo;Demon;Female;Yushiro! The next time you hit that boy, I'll make you regret it!
530;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Yes, ma'am! She's beautiful even when she's angry!
531;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tamayo;Demon;Female;There's one thing I'd like to clear up with you. I'm not trying to create more demons. I only perform the procedure on the terminally ill or those so gravely injured that they don't have long to live. And in those cases, I always ask them beforehand if they wish to live on even as demons.
532;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;The scent she's giving off is pure and devoid of deception. She's someone I can trust. Miss Tamayo, is there a way to return a transformed demon back to human form?
533;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;See anything?
534;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Yahaba (Arrow Demon);Demon;Male;I can see. I can see footprints. This is it. This is it. Making a huge turn over there. There are three of them. And one's carrying some kind of big box.
535;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;How should we kill them, I wonder. I can feel the flow of power. Because of all the blood he shared with me.
536;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Yahaba (Arrow Demon);Demon;Male;Of course we're going to slay them vindictively.
537;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tamayo;Demon;Female;There is a way to turn a demon... back into a human.
538;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Please tell me how!
539;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Don't you dare get so close to Lady Tamayo!
540;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tamayo;Demon;Female;Yushiro...
541;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Yes, ma'am! I only threw him. Lady Tamayo. I did not hit him.
542;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tamayo;Demon;Female;You mustn't do either.
543;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Yes, ma'am!
544;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Ouch, ouch, ouch. Please tell me how.
545;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tamayo;Demon;Female;For any kind of wound, there's always some kind of medicine or treatment. At this time, I'm unable to turn a demon back into a human, but surely, that, too... However, we are dedicated to establishing such a method of treatment. Towards that end, I'd like to ask you to do something for me. To produce such an elixir, it is necessary to study the blood of numerous demons. I have two favors to ask of you. One, permission to study your sister's blood. Two, to retrieve blood samples from demons as closely related to Kibutsuji as possible. Nezuko's current condition is extremely rare and unique. I understand that she was asleep for two straight years, and I believe that her body underwent changes during that time. Normally, any demon who went that long without consuming the flesh or blood of a human or beast would unquestionably go berserk.
546;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Lady Tamayo is beautiful today, too! I'm sure she'll be beautiful again tomorrow!
547;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tamayo;Demon;Female;And yet, surprisingly, Nezuko shows none of those signs. This miracle will be the key to finding a solution.
548;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Nezuko...
549;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tamayo;Demon;Female;The other request I have for you is a harsh one. By "demons closely related to Kibutsuji," I meant demons whose powers are more on par with that of Kibutsuji himself. It won't be easy to extract blood from such demons. Are you still willing to go along with my requests?
550;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tanjiro;Human;Male;If there's no other way, then I'll do it. If it means you're going to research all these demons' blood and create this medicine... If that happens, that means it won't just be Nezuko. Lots of other people will be saved, too, right?
551;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Tamayo;Demon;Female;That's right.
552;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Get down!
553;1;8;The Smell of Enchanting Blood;Yahaba (Arrow Demon);Demon;Male;Did you decide how to kill them?
554;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;How should we kill them, I wonder. I can feel the flow of power. Because of all the blood he shared with me.
555;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Yahaba (Arrow Demon);Demon;Male;Of course we're going to slay them vindictively.
556;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Get down!
557;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Yahaba (Arrow Demon);Demon;Male;Did you decide how to kill them?
558;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;Vindictively, of course! You were right, Yahaba! A building just appeared out of nowhere!
559;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Yahaba (Arrow Demon);Demon;Male;The handiwork of a Blood Demon Arts wielder adept at hiding objects. And is the demon hunter accompanied by a demon? What's going on here?
560;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;Isn't this fun?
561;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Yahaba (Arrow Demon);Demon;Male;Still, I have to say, Susamaru... Your way of doing things is so immature. So careless. You splattered me! You splattered my kimono with dust!
562;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;Oh, stop whining! We found them right away thanks to my temari, so who cares? And now we can have tons of fun!
563;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Yahaba (Arrow Demon);Demon;Male;You've gone and splattered me again!
564;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;You're so uptight. Your kimono isn't the least bit soiled. And besides... Found 'em! Found 'em!
565;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;A temari! So, she caused all this damage by throwing that temari?
566;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Yushiro;Demon;Male;That woman... Is she one of Kibutsuji's minions? Lady Tamayo!
567;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yushiro! Dammit! Nezuko! Take the lady sleeping in the back room somewhere safe outside!
568;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tamayo;Demon;Female;It's too dangerous outside! We have a basement, so take her there!
569;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Understood! Nezuko!
570;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;That's one down!
571;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;She's giving off a totally different scent than any of the other demons! Is it stronger? It's a really thick scent! It feels so heavy once it enters my lungs!
572;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;The demon hunter wearing hanafuda-like earrings... It's you, isn't it?
573;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;So, I'm the one they're targeting? Miss Tamayo! Please find a place to hide! I'm the one those demons are after!
574;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tamayo;Demon;Female;Tanjiro, I want you to fight without worrying about us. We'll be fine without your protection. Since we're demons.
575;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;All right. It's all over for you now!
576;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;That temari will only swerve if I dodge it. Of the ten forms... The fastest thrusting technique... Total Concentration... Water Breathing! Seventh Form, Drop Ripple Thrust-curve!
577;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;Oh, so you thrust at the curve diagonally to soften the temari's blow. But...
578;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;How can that temari move around like that? It swerved unnaturally when it struck Yushiro, as well! It's not like it's spinning in any special way, and yet... What is this?
579;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tamayo;Demon;Female;Yushiro! Yushiro!
580;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Yushiro;Demon;Male;La... Lady Tamayo! Didn't I tell you? That we shouldn't get involved with that demon hunter! From the start! My Blindfold technique is still a work in progress! I know you're well aware of that yourself! I may be able to conceal the presence of buildings and people, their scent, but it's not like I can mask their very existence! The greater our numbers, the more traces we'll leave, and the greater the odds that Kibutsuji will discover us!
581;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Those demons got this close to us, yet there was no scent until we came under attack! That was Yushiro's Blood Demon Art, huh?
582;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Anyone who ruins the time I spend alone with you... I despise such people! I despise them with passion! It's unforgivable!
583;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;Hey, he's babbling! What fun this is! What fun this is! To be killed by me, one of the Twelve Demon Moons... You should be honored!
584;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Twelve Demon Moons?
585;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tamayo;Demon;Female;They serve directly under Kibutsuji!
586;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;She grew more arms!
587;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;Now then, let's keep playing! Until morning comes! Until you die!
588;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tamayo;Demon;Female;If I were to cast my spell now, it would affect Tanjiro, as well. And Yushiro needs time to prepare to switch to attack mode. But if this goes on...
589;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;There it is again! Even without hitting anything, they changed trajectory! If I go ahead and slash them, it blunts the blow, but then they hit me anyway! Two different scents of blood. There are two demons! Their scent tells me where they are! But... Miss Tamayo! Yushiro! It's no good! I don't have time to protect them!
590;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tamayo;Demon;Female;We'll be healed soon enough! So don't worry!
591;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Hey! Moron demon hunter! If you look at the arrows, you can tell which direction they're going! Dodge the arrows!
592;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Arrows?
593;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Seriously, you can't even see them? I'm going to lend you my sense of sight! That should at least enable you to behead that temari woman!
594;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I can see now! She was using these arrows to control... ...the trajectory of the temari! Thanks, Yushiro! I can see the arrows now, too!
595;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Then, hurry up and defeat her!
596;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Nezuko! Nezuko, let's go outside! Take care of the demon up in the tree! I'm the one you want to take on!
597;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;The demon hunter wearing hanafuda-like earrings... No question. I'm going to bring that head of yours to him. What fun this is!
598;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Nezuko, how much longer? They're gone! Water Breathing... Third Form, Flowing Dance! Miss Tamayo! Are these two demons closely related to Kibutsuji?
599;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tamayo;Demon;Female;Most likely.
600;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Then, I'm going to extract blood from them for sure!
601;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tamayo;Demon;Female;I have two favors to ask of you. One, permission to study your sister's blood. Two, to retrieve blood samples from demons as closely related to Kibutsuji as possible. By "demons closely related to Kibutsuji," I meant demons whose powers are more on par with that of Kibutsuji himself. It won't be easy to extract blood from such demons.
602;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Third Form, Flowing Dance! Miss Tamayo! Are these two demons closely related to Kibutsuji?
603;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tamayo;Demon;Female;Most likely.
604;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;You think you're going to extract blood from us? I don't know what you're scheming, but I won't allow you to do anything to displease him! If you think you can extract blood from us Twelve Demon Moons, then have at it!
605;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Watch your back! Don't let your guard down for a second! If those two really are Twelve Demon Moons, then they're undeniably more formidable than any other demon you've killed until now!
606;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Right! Understood! Watch my back, don't let my guard down for a second, undeniably... until now... Right! I'll do my best!
607;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Lady Tamayo! Let's use those two as decoys and escape! I'm just kidding!
608;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Yahaba (Arrow Demon);Demon;Male;Don't stir up dust like that. So filthy!
609;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;She grew new arms in such a short time! She can regenerate way faster than those Final Selection demons!
610;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;I'm going to bring that head of yours to him.
611;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Nezuko!
612;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;Now then, why don't you both die at once?
613;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Are you okay, Nezuko?
614;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Hey, Demon Hunter! You get rid of that arrow man first! We'll take on the temari woman with your sister!
615;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Understood! Nezuko, whatever you do, don't push yourself too hard. I'm counting on you. I swear... I'm going to extract their blood! If it means the medicine will be perfected even a minute sooner, I'll gladly fight any demon! I'll fight and win! There it is! Opening Thread!
616;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Yahaba (Arrow Demon);Demon;Male;What a grimy little urchin you are. You stay away from me!
617;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;The thread snapped! This hurts! I mean this really... It seriously hurts! A move! Unleash a move to blunt the attack! Eighth Form, Waterfall Basin!
618;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;He vanished?
619;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Yushiro;Demon;Male;You hurt Lady Tamayo! I'll never forgive you for that!
620;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Yahaba (Arrow Demon);Demon;Male;Tamayo? Hey, Susamaru, the one over there... Wouldn't that be Tamayo the Fugitive? What a great souvenir she'll make!
621;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;Is that right?
622;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Idiot!
623;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tamayo;Demon;Female;You mustn't kick it!
624;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;What fun this is! What fun this is! I like kemari, too! Yahaba! Will four heads be enough to take home?
625;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Yahaba (Arrow Demon);Demon;Male;No. We're taking two. The demon hunter and the fugitive. We have no use for the other two.
626;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tamayo;Demon;Female;Nezuko... The bleeding isn't stopping instantly. She's recovering so slowly. This medicine will help heal your leg right away, all right?
627;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;What should I do? I can't lose no matter what! But even if I can see the Opening Thread, it won't be easy to slash him! Any move would be pointless unless I can land my blow in the opening with pinpoint accuracy! If I'm off by even a little, the move won't be nearly as potent! He'll only change the sword's direction using his arrow skills! And I hate to say it, but those eyeballs on his hands are creepy! Though I hate to say it! The speed of this arrow! It's not going to disappear until it hits me! And I can't slash it with my sword! The instant the blade touches it, I'll get blasted away in the arrow's direction! What should I do?
628;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Yahaba (Arrow Demon);Demon;Male;It's all going the way I want it to! Your arm's going to get twisted right off! So, you eluded it by spinning in the same direction as the Kouketsu Arrow? Damn monkey!
629;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I can't take much more of his attacks! I gotta strike back! I gotta change the arrow's direction without touching it directly!
630;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Yahaba (Arrow Demon);Demon;Male;It's about time for you to die!
631;1;9;Temari Demon and Arrow Demon;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Adapt your moves! First, use the Sixth Form to envelope the arrow! Then use the footwork of the Third Form... to close in on him! Twist! Envelope! Twisting Whirlpool-Flowing Water! My sword's so heavy! But... Second Form... Modified! Horizontal Water Wheel!
632;1;10;Together Forever;Yahaba (Arrow Demon);Demon;Male;It's about time for you to die!
633;1;10;Together Forever;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Twist! Envelope! Twisting Whirlpool-Flowing Water! My sword's so heavy! But... Second Form... Improved, Lateral Water Wheel! I did it! The Whirlpool move loses force when it's not underwater! But thanks to my opponent's attack, it gained power, and I was able to envelope the arrows!
634;1;10;Together Forever;Yahaba (Arrow Demon);Demon;Male;Damn! Curse you! Curse you! Curse you! All I had to do was bring back your head, and I would've won his approval! I'll never forgive you! I'll never ever forgive you! Shoving my face into this vile dirt! You're going down with me!
635;1;10;Together Forever;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Oh no! He's gonna get me! I'm getting pulled by a force stronger than the arrows he's hit me with! I gotta unleash move after move and go on the defensive, or my body's going to get smashed! Fourth Form, Striking Tide! The pressure is bearing down on my body, and I can't swing my sword! Unleash one! Unleash a move! Not here! Don't let yourself get beat! Second Form, Water Wheel! Waterfall Basin! Water Surface Slash! Drop Ripple Thrust-curve! Whirlpool! I've never made this many consecutive moves before! It feels like both my arms are about to get torn off! Nowhere near enough!
636;1;10;Together Forever;Yahaba (Arrow Demon);Demon;Male;More... Suffer more!
637;1;10;Together Forever;Tanjiro;Human;Male;How many more times? How many? Don't think about it! Just keep unleashing moves! Keep throwing them out!
638;1;10;Together Forever;Yahaba (Arrow Demon);Demon;Male;Not yet! It's still not enough yet!
639;1;10;Together Forever;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Nezuko... Miss Tamayo... Yushiro... I've got a broken rib and leg. N-No good! I'm too exhausted to grip my sword! I gotta get over there! There's still one more demon! I'll be there soon! I'll be there soon! So be safe, all right? Please... be safe!
640;1;10;Together Forever;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Ridiculous! It's child's play for me to evade a linear attack like this! Locating you is a breeze, as well!
641;1;10;Together Forever;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;The same goes for you! No matter how well you might conceal yourself, I can see you clear as day! What fun this is!
642;1;10;Together Forever;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Hey you! Don't be so rash just because you're immortal! Wh-What's wrong? What do you think you're doing? Here it comes! Look at her. Lady Tamayo...
643;1;10;Together Forever;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;You little brat! You little brat! So, now you can kick my temari back at me? How insolent! You damn brat!
644;1;10;Together Forever;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Unbelievable. Lady Tamayo, is this...
645;1;10;Together Forever;Tamayo;Demon;Female;I used a healing serum on her. Nothing more. Made exclusively for demons. It doesn't make one physically stronger. What we're seeing is Nezuko's own power. Without devouring human blood... Solely on her own... Nezuko is gaining strength at a rapid rate. However, her opponent is also formidable. If she were to go all-out, Nezuko wouldn't stand a chance. I've got to... do something.
646;1;10;Together Forever;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;You're an amusing little girl! This time, I'm going all-out against you! I wonder how long you can hold out!
647;1;10;Together Forever;Tamayo;Demon;Female;Twelve Kizuki demon girl there.
648;1;10;Together Forever;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;You're in my way! Step back, you damn fugitive!
649;1;10;Together Forever;Tamayo;Demon;Female;Just tell me one thing please. Are you aware of Kibutsuji's true identity?
650;1;10;Together Forever;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;What the hell did you say?
651;1;10;Together Forever;Tamayo;Demon;Female;That man is nothing but a coward. He lives in constant fear of something.
652;1;10;Together Forever;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;Stop it! Damn you! Stop it!
653;1;10;Together Forever;Tamayo;Demon;Female;Do you know why it is that demons can't band together? The reason why demons cannibalize each other? It's to prevent other demons from banding together and attacking him. He manipulates demons to act this way. Demons like you.
654;1;10;Together Forever;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;Shut up! Shut up, shut up! No way is he that petty!
655;1;10;Together Forever;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Lady Tamayo... is casting a spell.
656;1;10;Together Forever;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;The power he wields is mind-blowing! There's no one stronger than him! Not Lord Kibutsuji!
657;1;10;Together Forever;Tamayo;Demon;Female;You've uttered that name out loud, haven't you? That will trigger the curse.
658;1;10;Together Forever;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Magical Aroma of Daylight. It weakens its target's brain functions, rendering that person unable to lie or keep secrets. It's immensely potent, Lady Tamayo!
659;1;10;Together Forever;Tamayo;Demon;Female;I do feel sorry for you, but... farewell.
660;1;10;Together Forever;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;Please forgive me! Please forgive me! I'm begging you! Please! Please forgive me!
661;1;10;Together Forever;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Did she just die?
662;1;10;Together Forever;Tamayo;Demon;Female;She will die momentarily. That's the curse. Her physical body will be destroyed by Kibutsuji's cells still in her body. In general, battles between demons are futile. It's pointless. Because they can't inflict fatal wounds on each other. Only sunlight and the swords of the Demon Slayers can do so. Kibutsuji alone appears to be able to destroy demon cells.
663;1;10;Together Forever;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Don't go inhaling Lady Tamayo's spell! It's harmful to the human body! You got that?
664;1;10;Together Forever;Tamayo;Demon;Female;Tanjiro... She is not one of the Twelve Kizuki. The Twelve Kizuki have numbers engraved on their eyeballs, but this demon doesn't have one. Most likely, the other demon isn't a member of the Twelve Kizuki, either. They're too weak.
665;1;10;Together Forever;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Too weak? At that level?
666;1;10;Together Forever;Yushiro;Demon;Male;If Lady Tamayo says so, there's no mistake. Still, who knew there were such stupid demons? She physically injured Lady Tamayo. She got exactly what she deserved.
667;1;10;Together Forever;Tamayo;Demon;Female;I hope this blood will be instrumental in developing the healing serum. I'm going to take care of Nezuko. Not only did I medicate her, she also inhaled my spell inadvertently. I'm so sorry.
668;1;10;Together Forever;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Don't move a muscle! You're on your own now! I don't want to leave Lady Tamayo's side! Not for a second!
669;1;10;Together Forever;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;Ma... ri... Mari... Mari...
670;1;10;Together Forever;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Here's your mari.
671;1;10;Together Forever;Susamaru (Temari Demon);Demon;Female;Play with me. Play with me.
672;1;10;Together Forever;Tanjiro;Human;Male;You're just like a little kid. Even though you must've murdered scores of people. You were deluded into thinking you were in the Twelve Kizuki. Deceived... Compelled to fight... And now, you were killed by the Kibutsuji curse. There's no salvation. Even after you die, not even your bones will remain. Is this the price you pay for killing others? Kibutsuji... This is how that man treats even those who revere him! He's a true... demon! Miss Tamayo! Yushiro?
673;1;10;Together Forever;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Over here! Over here! Not that you need to come at all. But if you want to, then get down here.
674;1;10;Together Forever;Tamayo;Demon;Female;Yushiro!
675;1;10;Together Forever;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Only joking!
676;1;10;Together Forever;Tamayo;Demon;Female;Hurry down, then, Tanjiro!
677;1;10;Together Forever;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Oh, right! Nezuko!
678;1;10;Together Forever;Tamayo;Demon;Female;I moved her to this basement, where the sunlight won't reach her, ahead of daybreak.
679;1;10;Together Forever;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Nezuko?
680;1;10;Together Forever;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Why, you! Step away from Lady Tamayo! That's so rude!
681;1;10;Together Forever;Tamayo;Demon;Female;Stop it, Yushiro. I don't mind at all.
682;1;10;Together Forever;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Yes, ma'am! You have such a kind heart, Lady Tamayo. You're too beautiful to believe! Cut... that... out!
683;1;10;Together Forever;Tamayo;Demon;Female;Nezuko has been acting in this way since she awoke. Do you think she's all right?
684;1;10;Together Forever;Tanjiro;Human;Male;There's nothing to worry about. She's fine. She probably thinks you're someone in our family.
685;1;10;Together Forever;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Cut it out!
686;1;10;Together Forever;Tamayo;Demon;Female;Family? But I thought the spell Nezuko is under causes her to see humans as her family. And Yushiro and I are demons.
687;1;10;Together Forever;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Cut it out!
688;1;10;Together Forever;Tanjiro;Human;Male;But Nezuko has perceived you two as humans. That's why she tried to protect you. At first, I didn't like the idea of Nezuko being under a spell, but since it looks like she has a will of her own, I'm glad thatâ€” I-I'm so sorry! Nezuko! Nezuko! S-Step away from her! It's rude, all right?
689;1;10;Together Forever;Tamayo;Demon;Female;Thank you... Nezuko! Thank you! Do you still wish to live? Do you still wish to live even if you're no longer human? If this goes on, you will most likely succumb to your illness. However, losing your humanity will cause you pain and grief. Do you still wish to live? Yushiro and I will leave this region. We've gotten too close to Kibutsuji. We must conceal our whereabouts soon or the risk will be too great. Not to mention, even if I think I've concealed my identity, when I interact with humans as a doctor, people sometimes see through me as a demon. The young and the elderly are particularly perceptive. Tanjiro...
690;1;10;Together Forever;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yes?
691;1;10;Together Forever;Tamayo;Demon;Female;Would you like us to take Nezuko in? I can't give you an absolute guarantee that she'll be safe, but I believe it will be less dangerous than taking her into battle.
692;1;10;Together Forever;Tanjiro;Human;Male;That might be true. She's right. It would be better for Nezuko to be in their care. Miss Tamayo, thank you so much for your concern. But... Nezuko and I are staying together. We're not going to live apart from each other. Never again.
693;1;10;Together Forever;Tamayo;Demon;Female;Very well. In that case, I wish you long-lasting good fortune in battle.
694;1;10;Together Forever;Yushiro;Demon;Male;All right. We'll be leaving after we erase all traces of ourselves. You two get going now!
695;1;10;Together Forever;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Right! Okay, Miss Tamayo, Yushiro, we wish you well! Let's go, Nezuko. Hey! Don't go rushing off like that!
696;1;10;Together Forever;Yushiro;Demon;Male;Tanjiro! Your kid sister... is a beauty.
697;1;10;Together Forever;Crow;Bird;Bird;South-southeast! South-southeast! South-southeast! Your next location is south-southeast!
698;1;10;Together Forever;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I heard you! I heard, so give me a break and quiet down! I'm begging you! I got the message, so please!
699;1;10;Together Forever;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Please! Please! Please! Please! Please marry me! I could die any day, you know! That's why I want you to marry me! So please! Please, I'm begging you!
700;1;10;Together Forever;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Wh-What's up with that? What on earth?
701;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Crow;Bird;Bird;South-southeast! Your next location is south-southeast!
702;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I heard you! I heard, so give me a break and quiet down! I'm begging you! I got the message, so please!
703;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Please! Please! Please! Please! Please marry me! I could die any day, you know! That's why I want you to marry me! So please! Please, I'm begging you!
704;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Wh-What's up with that? What on earth? Huh?
705;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;I'm begging you! There's no one else! You're all that I have!
706;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I see! Gotcha! I'll do something about it!
707;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Please help me! Please marry me! I'm beggingâ€”
708;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;What do you think you're doing right in the middle of the road? Can't you see she wants no part of you? And don't go making trouble for your sparrow, either!
709;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;That uniform! You're that guy from Final Selection!
710;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;No one I know is anything like you! I don't know you!
711;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;But we met, remember? We met, remember? You're the one with the problem! Like your memory!
712;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;All right, it's been taken care of. You can head home now without any worries.
713;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Girl 2;Human;Female;I will. Thank you very much!
714;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Hey! Stay out of my way! That girl is going to marry me! Because she's in love with me, all riâ€” Hey! Ouch! That hurts! Stop it! Stop it! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!
715;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;H-Hey, calm down!
716;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Girl 2;Human;Female;When did I ever tell you that I loved you? You were crumpled up on the side of the road looking ill, and all I did was speak to you!
717;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;You mean you didn't reach out to me out of love because you were worried?
718;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Girl 2;Human;Female;I already have a fiancÃ©, so not on your life! With all that energy, you must be fine now, right? Goodbye!
719;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;W-Wait, come back! Come...
720;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Look, cut it out!
721;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Wh-Why'd you get in my way? This has nothing to do with you! What's with that look on your face? Stop that! Why are you staring at me like I'm a creature or something? Hey you! You're responsible for it! Since it's your fault that I missed out on getting married! Jeez, say something! Listen up! I'm going to die soon! During my next job! The thing is, I'm horribly weak, okay? I'm not kidding! You gotta protect me until I manage to get married, all right?
722;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;My name is Tanjiro Kamado!
723;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Is that right? My apologies! I'm Zenitsu Agatsuma! Please save me, Tanjiro!
724;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;What do you mean, save you? What was your reason for becoming a swordsman, Zenitsu? Why are you being so blatantly shameless?
725;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;That's a harsh way to put it! I got swindled by a woman and racked up all this debt! The old geezer who took it over for me was a cultivator! Day after day, I had to go through hellish training! It was so bad that I thought I'd be better off dead! I was hoping I could die during Final Selection! But since I was lucky enough to survive, I'm still going through hell every day! I'm so scared! Scared! Scared! Scared! I just know that I'm gonna get devoured and killed soon by a demon! My brains are gonna get sucked through my ears while I'm still alive! No! No! Please save me!
726;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;What's the matter? Are you okay? How are you?
727;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Yeah. Now that I'm calmer, I'm getting hungry.
728;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Don't you have any food on you?
729;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Nope.
730;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Here, take this. Would like to eat it?
731;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Hey, thanks. You're not eating, Tanjiro?
732;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;No, since that's all I've got.
733;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Here. You eat half.
734;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;You sure? Thanks! I know what you mean when you say you're scared of demons, but you can't make trouble for your sparrow.
735;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Was it distressed? The sparrow? How can you tell?
736;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Well, he says that you're always whining about not wanting to go to work, and you're always hitting on girls, and that you snore so loud, he's had it! So he says.
737;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;He's saying that? You can understand bird language? You're lying, right? You're just trying to trick me!
738;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Crow;Bird;Bird;Start running! Start running! Tanjiro, Zenitsu, run! Both of you head over to your next destination! Run! Run, Tanjiro, Zenitsu!
739;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;That crow is talking! Hey, Tanjiro, on second thought, I'm not gonna make it. Even if I go along, I'm gonna be totally useless.
740;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;The demon scent is getting stronger little by little. There's something up ahead. What's that? I can smell blood. But this particular scent...
741;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;You smell something?
742;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Something I've never smelled before.
743;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;I don't know about that, but do you hear that sound? Also, are you and I gonna work together, after all?
744;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Sound?
745;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;K-Kids...
746;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I wonder what's wrong. Hey, guys, what are you doing here? They seem really spooked. Okay, wanna see something cool? Ta-da! It's a tame sparrow! See? Isn't he cute? Please tell me. Did something happen? Is this your house?
747;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Shoichi;Human;Male;No. No, it's not. This... This is... A-A monster's... house! Our big brother got taken away. When we were walking down the road at night, this monster we'd never seen before showed up. It didn't give us a glance. Just our brother.
748;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;And they went inside that house, right?
749;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Shoichi;Human;Male;Yeah. Yeah.
750;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Did you two follow them here? You did good! Great job!
751;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Shoichi;Human;Male;We followed the traces of his blood. Because he got hurt!
752;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Hurt... Don't worry! We're going to defeat the bad guy and rescue your brother!
753;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Shoichi;Human;Male;Really? You really will?
754;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yeah. For sure!
755;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Tanjiro... Hey, what is this sound? This creepy sound never stops. Is it a tsuzumi?
756;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Sound? I don't hear any. Don't look! Are you all right? Are you all right? Stay with me! The wound is so deep. Is this...
757;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Dying mansion boy;Human;Male;Even though... I got out... Even though I made it out... Made it outside. Still... Am I gonna die? Am I still gonna die?
758;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;And now he's gone... It must've hurt a lot. You must've suffered.
759;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Tanjiro, by any chance, is that guy these kids'...
760;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;We couldn't save him. If only we'd gotten here a little sooner, we might've managed to save him. Hey, is this man your...
761;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Shoichi;Human;Male;I-It's not Brother. Brother's wearing a persimmon-colored kimono.
762;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I see. So it's captured more than one person. I promise to bury you when I return. Forgive me. Forgive me. All right. Zenitsu, come on! But no one else can help them now but you and me. Really? All right, then.
763;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Hey, come on! Why are you making that ogre face at me? Okay, I'll go!
764;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I have no intention of forcing you to.
765;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;I said I'll go!
766;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;In case of an emergency, I'm leaving this box behind. Even if something happens, you two will be protected. Okay, we're going now.
767;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Tanjiro! Hey, Tanjiro! You'll protect me, right? You'll protect me, right?
768;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Zenitsu, I hate to put you on the spot, but... I've got a broken rib and leg from my previous battle. And neither are fully healed yet. Soâ€”
769;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;What do you mean, broken bones? Don't go breaking any bones on me! If you've got fractures, you can't possibly protect me! I-I-I'm gonna die! What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? I'm gonna die now! Gonna die, gonna die, gonna die! Broken bones? How could you? I'm a dead man now! 99.9% dead! I'm dead! I'm dead! I'm dead!
770;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Zenitsu, quiet down! You'll be all right!
771;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Don't sugarcoat it!
772;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'm not! I can tell, all right? Zenitsu, you'reâ€” No good! You shouldn't be here!
773;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Shoichi;Human;Male;M-Mister, we heard scratching sounds from inside that box!
774;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;E-Even still, it pains me that you left it behind! I mean, it's more precious to me than my own life!
775;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Sorry! My butt...
776;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;It's a different room. No. Were we the ones that moved? To the beat of that tsuzumi? Sorry you got separated from your brother, okay? But I'm gonna protect you no matter what. And Zenitsu is gonna protect your brother. Don't worry! What's your name?
777;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Teruko;Human;Female;Teruko.
778;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Is that right? Teruko? That's a fine name you haveâ€” Even among all these scents, this is the strongest one that this house is steeped in! This one's devoured a whole slew of humans! This one's the master of this house!
779;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;I'm gonna die! Gonna die, gonna die, gonna die, I'm telling you! Tanjiro and I got split up!
780;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Shoichi;Human;Male;Teruko! Teruko!
781;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;No, no, no, no! Don't yell like that! If you yell and the bad guy hears you, it won't be pretty! Come on, let's step outside!
782;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Shoichi;Human;Male;What... Why outside? Are you trying to escape all by yourself? All this constant yammering about dying... Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Clinging onto a younger person... Don't you feel pathetic? What are you wearing that sword on your hip for anyway?
783;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Those words cut so deep. That's not it! I'm not gonna be of any use anyway,
784;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Shoichi;Human;Male;Let me go!
785;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;so I'm gonna summon a grownup here, okay?
786;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Shoichi;Human;Male;Let me go!
787;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Because this isn't something us kids can resolve on our own! You're kidding me, kidding me, kidding me! I'm sure this was the front door! Where'd the outside go? I mean, this door was... Is it this one? How about this one? What about this one? It's a monster! What the heck? What's that look in your eyes? Stop looking at me like that!
788;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Kyogai (Drum Demon);Demon;Male;If it hadn't been... If it hadn't been for their meddling...
789;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Teruko, you gotta try not to scream. The room's going to flip around, so don't go into the hall. Step back and hide behind the shelves.
790;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Kyogai (Drum Demon);Demon;Male;Curses, curses! Thanks to them, he got away! When he was my prey! Why is it? Why do they all keep barging into someone else's home? It's infuriating. That was my prey! My own prey, discovered on my own turf! Curse them! Curse them!
791;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Hey! Listen! I'm with the Demon Slayers Corp. Rank 10, Tanjiro Kamado! I'm going to slay you now!
792;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Kyogai (Drum Demon);Demon;Male;A child with rare blood that I found myself!
793;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Got him! Teruko! Now the tatami floors are on the sides! The room's been flipped! So, this is that demon's Blood Demon Art! This entire house is this demon's territory! What's this? An odd scent is wafting this way. It's not a demon!
794;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Inosuke;Human;Male;Comin' through! Comin' through! Comin' through!
795;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Wh-Who's that guy? He's wearing a boar's hide! And he's wielding Nichirin Swords!
796;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Inosuke;Human;Male;All right, you monster... Die on the battlefield and serve as my springboard! So that I can become more powerful and soar even higher!
797;1;11;Tsuzumi Mansion;Kyogai (Drum Demon);Demon;Male;Infuriating! Infuriating!
798;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Inosuke;Human;Male;Here goes... Comin'... through!
799;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Kyogai (Drum Demon);Demon;Male;Infuriating! Infuriating!
800;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Teruko! Hold onto the furniture! That one's a demon with supernatural powers! Stop launching those reckless assaults!
801;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Kyogai (Drum Demon);Demon;Male;Infuriating! You damn insects running amok in my house!
802;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Inosuke;Human;Male;The room freakin' spun around! This is fun! This is fun!
803;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Don't stomp all over her!
804;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Inosuke;Human;Male;Who the hell are you?
805;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Tanjiro;Human;Male;What do you think you're doing, stepping on a little kid like that?
806;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Inosuke;Human;Male;I like it! I like it! No human's ever sent me flying like that before!
807;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Why is he coming after me? Isn't he a Demon Slayer?
808;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Inosuke;Human;Male;My swords will hurt you. Because they're not the kind of swords you little gentlemen use! The way they shred through flesh... That's what I pride myself on!
809;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Knock it off! There's a demon right there, you know!
810;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Inosuke;Human;Male;Like I care!
811;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Kyogai (Drum Demon);Demon;Male;Damn insects! Out of my sight! Die!
812;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Tanjiro;Human;Male;The floor ripped apart all of a sudden! At the same speed as the sound of the tsuzumi! In the shape of a beast's claws! Spinning right! Spinning left!
813;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Kyogai (Drum Demon);Demon;Male;Damn insects! You damn miserable insects!
814;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'm starting to get the hang of it now! We're in yet another room now? But what does this mean? That demon didn't strike his tsuzumi just now. I'm picking up the scent of multiple demons in this house. Is there another demon with a tsuzumi, then? Is that why... I can smell blood. It's gonna be all right, okay? Just stay behind me.
815;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Teruko;Human;Female;Okay.
816;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Another human ripped to shreds and devoured!
817;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Teruko;Human;Female;Wh-What's the matter?
818;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Tanjiro;Human;Male;It's all right. There are no demons around. Come on, let's head over there. Without a backward glance. Look straight ahead, okay? Now there's another scent. A unique scent of blood I've never smelled before. Looks like there wasn't that much bleeding.
819;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Shoichi;Human;Male;Excuse me, Zenitsu.
820;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Signal... Signal... Signal... Signal me first! If you want to talk, don't come at me all of a sudden! My heart nearly flew out of my mouth just now!
821;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Shoichi;Human;Male;I'm sorry.
822;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Zenitsu;Human;Male;If that had come to pass, that would've made you a murderer for sure! Do you get that?
823;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Shoichi;Human;Male;It's just that... See... You've been sweating, gasping and shivering so horribly.
824;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Zenitsu;Human;Male;What about it? Aren't I doing the best I can here?
825;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Shoichi;Human;Male;Well, forgive me for saying so, but you're making me nervous, too, so...
826;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Oh no! Sorry about that! Even still... Even still... If we talk too much, those demons and all will... They might find us, right? That's why... I think it would be best to be as quiet as possible! Right?
827;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Tongue Demon;Demon;Male;A couple of kids. Probably most agreeable to the tongue.
828;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Zenitsu;Human;Male;What did I tell you? A demon showed up! A demon showed up, understand? Stay away! Stay away from us! Stop that! W-W-We don't taste good! I'm sure I taste awful! I'm serious, okay? This kid's all skin and bones, so he's all dry and tastes ghastly!
829;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Tongue Demon;Demon;Male;How will I know until I have a taste?
830;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Nooooo! What was that? Quick-tongued! Splitting a vase in two! That's just not possible!
831;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Shoichi;Human;Male;Zenitsu! Get up!
832;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Zenitsu;Human;Male;It's in my knees now! 80 percent of my fear is in my knees!
833;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Shoichi;Human;Male;This is no time to whine, all right?
834;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Just leave me behind, okay? Make a run for it!
835;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Shoichi;Human;Male;I can't do something like that!
836;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Zenitsu;Human;Male;What a great kid this is! Even though I'm making terrified sounds like this! I gotta find a way somehow! If I don't protect him, what will become of him? Dying before he reaches double digits would be way too tragic! But I'm so horribly weak!
837;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Shoichi;Human;Male;Get up!
838;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Zenitsu;Human;Male;I don't have the ability to protect him! But if I don't protect him...
839;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Tongue Demon;Demon;Male;I'm gonna guzzle your brain matter through your ears!
840;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Shoichi;Human;Male;Zenitsu! Zenitâ€” He's fast asleep.
841;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Tongue Demon;Demon;Male;What's up with him? Die!
842;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Shoichi;Human;Male;Zenitsu! Please wake up!
843;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Tongue Demon;Demon;Male;Wh-What's this sound? This guy... He's giving off a different vibe!
844;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Shoichi;Human;Male;Zenitsu...
845;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Thunder Breathing First Form, Thunderclap and Flash. It's dead! All of a sudden, it's dead! What the hell? I can't take this! What is this? What is this? Yuck! Shoichi... Don't tell me... Thank you! You saved my life! I shall be eternally grateful to you for this! Why didn't you tell me sooner that you were so powerful?
846;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Shoichi;Human;Male;What are you talking about?
847;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Did you say something?
848;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Shoichi;Human;Male;No. Uh, no. Forget it. Let's go now, okay?
849;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Okay.
850;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Inosuke;Human;Male;Damn! He sent me flying again! It's been like this for the last three days, dammit! Making my way through a cramped building like this... It's just not my thing for crying out loud!
851;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Horned Demon;Demon;Male;Hey, you dodged me. You seem to be a pretty fresh human. Your flesh will be well worth gouging out!
852;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Inosuke;Human;Male;Self-taught... Beast Breathing. It's gonna be so worth it to shred such a huge target!
853;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Horned Demon;Demon;Male;You've got guts to charge me head-on like that!
854;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Inosuke;Human;Male;Flaunt your corpse and serve as my springboard! Fang Three Devour! Comin' through! Comin' through!
855;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Kyogai (Drum Demon);Demon;Male;Marechi... Marechi... If I can just devour some... Fifty... No, a hundred humans' worth... I gotta search for more humans with marechi and consume them. That way... I can reclaim my place among the Twelve Kizuki!
856;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Muzan;Demon;N/a;Kyogai. You can't eat any more? Is that all you've got?
857;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Kyogai (Drum Demon);Demon;Male;No. No, I'm not done! P-Please give me more time! J-Just a little!
858;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Muzan;Demon;N/a;I've had enough. I'm stripping you of your number. That's your limit, and you've reached it.
859;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Kyogai (Drum Demon);Demon;Male;The more humans you devour, the stronger you can become. And once he saw my potential, Master Kibutsuji was willing to share his blood with me. The power of that man's blood was mind-boggling. I was sure that I'd grow infinitely stronger than ever before, be welcomed into the ranks of the Twelve Kizuki, continue to gorge myself on humans and become even more powerful! Or so I believed! Or so I believed.
860;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Teruko;Human;Female;Brother Kiyoshi! Brother! Brother!
861;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Kiyoshi;Human;Male;Teruko! Wh-Who's he?
862;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'm Tanjiro Kamado. I've come to defeat evil demons. Now then, show my your wounds. Good for you for hanging in there on your own.
863;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Teruko;Human;Female;Brother...
864;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Now this ointment here is amazing! My master gave it to me! My master always wears a goblin mask.
865;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Kiyoshi;Human;Male;Goblin? Really?
866;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yes, it's true. My master's ointment is so amazing, it works in a split second. Okay, you're all set! Well? The pain's gone, isn't it?
867;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Kiyoshi;Human;Male;Yes!
868;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Do you think you can you tell me what happened here?
869;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Kiyoshi;Human;Male;A monster dragged me away, a-and I nearly got devoured. But just then, another monster showed up out of nowhere, a-and they started fighting to the death over who was gonna get to e-eat me. A-And then, the one with the tsuzumi growing out of him... When the other monster defeated him, he dropped a tsuzumi! And when I picked it up and struck it, this room suddenly changed. And I somehow held on until now!
870;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Tanjiro;Human;Male;A demon with tsuzumi growing out of him... So that was him? He mentioned marechi or something like that.
871;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Kiyoshi;Human;Male;That's right! He kept calling me "Marechi"!
872;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Crow;Bird;Bird;What is "marechi"? It refers to the owner of rare blood! You little brats! I'm going to peck you now.
873;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Cut it out! What do you mean by "rare blood"?
874;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Crow;Bird;Bird;The blood of all living species can be categorized into types, idiot! And the ultimate marechi... The more scarce the blood, the more uncommon... For a demon! A single marechi human has the same nutritional value as eating fifty! One hundred humans! For demons, marechi is a feast! Marechi is their favorite food!
875;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Kyogai (Drum Demon);Demon;Male;Marechi... Marechi...
876;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'm leaving this room now. Keep calm. It's all right. I'm just going to take down that demon. Listen to me, Teruko. Right now, your brother is terribly exhausted. So, you gotta look after him, okay? As soon as I leave the room, strike that tsuzumi and move out. Just like Kiyoshi's been doing until now, whenever someone tries to open the door or you hear something, strike that tsuzumi right away and make a run for it. I promise to come get you. I'll follow your scent. I'll call out your names when I open the door. You just have to hold out a little longer. You can do it, right? Good for you! You're so strong! I'm heading out. Strike it!
877;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Kyogai (Drum Demon);Demon;Male;Damn insects! So infuriating!
878;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Tanjiro;Human;Male;The tsuzumi on his right shoulder flips the room right! The left one flips it left! Right leg, forward spin! Left leg, backward spin! The tsuzumi on his belly launches that claw attack! So fast! The speed of the rotations and attacks is devastating! Miss Tamayo did treat my wounds, but these injuries aren't fully healed yet! Can I beat him? Can I? These injuries hurt so bad I can hardly stand it! All this time, I've just been enduring it! When I pulled Zenitsu off that girl, when I shouted out, I was enduring the most terrible pain! I was able to withstand it because I'm the eldest son! But I couldn't have if I were the second son! Whenever I dig in, the broken parts creak, and I can't muster any strength. That demon's attack is leaving scars that look like claw marks. It scares me so much that I can't move in closer! Since I'm not at full strength, if I charge forward to get within striking distance, a flash of pain makes me stumble! I'll get sliced into rings! My injuries are making me imagine the most awful things! Mr. Urokodaki!
879;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Urokodaki;Human;Male;Water can change into any form. Pour it into a container, and it's a square. Pour it into a bottle, and it's round. Sometimes, it can even smash boulders and flow away as far as the eye can see.
880;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Tanjiro;Human;Male;That's right! That's right! There are ten Water Breathing forms! So, I can battle any kind of opponent! If you're hurt, then make a move that will compensate for it! I can take on any form! And this flow will never be stopped! Right now, it's not just my bones! My heart's also been broken!
881;1;12;The Boar Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps;Zenitsu;Human;Male;A broken Tanjiro's not gonna do any good!
882;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I've done a good job until now! I have what it takes! And not today... or any time in the future! Even if I'm broken... I'll never give up no matter what!
883;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Where are you, Tanjiro? I can still hear that creepy sound. Just be safe and sound, Tanjiro!
884;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Shoichi;Human;Male;Um, Zenitsu, is it just me, or are we just going around and around in circles?
885;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Zenitsu;Human;Male;I knew it! I was getting the same feeling! That's my boy, Shoichi! I knew I could count on you! All right, could you check to see if this room is safe? What the heck? All right, all right, just stop giving me that look! Fine, I'll do it myself! There's nobody around. Let's go this way! Tanjiro, please show up! Th-The room... just flipped!
886;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I can do it! I know I can do it! I'm a guy who gets things done! Broken bones or not... No matter what... I can do it! I can fight! Show him how unstoppable you are! Broken bones or not! It's no good! Nothing's changed at all! Spirit alone isn't gonna get me anywhere! Your head... Use your head, not just spirit! Think! Think! Think! Close call! I barely survived that one!
887;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Kyogai (Drum Demon);Demon;Male;Damn! This is so annoying! I gotta consume some marechi! There's no time to lose!
888;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Tanjiro;Human;Male;There isn't even time to stop and think! Hey you! What's your name?
889;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Kyogai (Drum Demon);Demon;Male;Kyogai.
890;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Kyogai! I'm not handing over Kiyoshi... the marechi to you! I'm not gonna cave! I'm not giving up!
891;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Kyogai's Lecture Man;Human;Male;Just give it up, will you?
892;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Kyogai (Drum Demon);Demon;Male;I'm going to get my hands on some marechi and reclaim my place among the Twelve Kizuki!
893;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Kyogai's Lecture Man;Human;Male;Just give it up, will you? It's so boring! Your writing is just so boring. Every last word is utter trash! No beauty, no fragility, no impact. Why don't you forget about writing? It's just a waste of paper and fountain pens! You never even step outside anymore these days. So no wonder you're so boring! You should just enjoy your hobby, playing the tsuzumi as long as you're shut in here. Not that you have the skills to teach that, either!
894;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Kyogai (Drum Demon);Demon;Male;Out of my sight! You damn insect! Rapid Drumming!
895;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Don't tell me he can strike that tsuzumi even faster! The speed of these rotations is making me dizzy! This is bad! What an amazing skill! Not only that, but now he's got five claws instead of three! Got it. Because I dodged his blows without stepping on the papers, I now know how to move my body without aggravating my wounds, and how to breathe! Take shallow breaths. Quickly! Use that breathing technique to reinforce the muscles around your broken leg! And right before the claw attack, there's the scent of mold! Here it comes! The claw attack! Above! Left! Right! Behind!
896;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Kyogai (Drum Demon);Demon;Male;He's evading all of my attacks!
897;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Total Concentration... Water Breathing! Ninth Form, Splashing Water Flow, Turbulent! Minimize the landing time and area as much as possible!
898;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Kyogai (Drum Demon);Demon;Male;He's adapting to the room's orientation changes!
899;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Go! Get in there! Within striking distance! Forward! Get right up in his face! I see the Opening Thread! Kyogai! Your Blood Demon Art was incredible! Ouch, ouch, ouch! I took a deep breath by mistake! I'm the eldest son! The eldest son!
900;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Kyogai (Drum Demon);Demon;Male;Boy... Answer me. You think my Blood Demon Art... was incredible?
901;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Tanjiro;Human;Male;It was amazing. But... I can't forgive you for killing others.
902;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Kyogai (Drum Demon);Demon;Male;I see.
903;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Oh, wait. I gotta get a blood sample. It extracted the blood. So, it really does extract blood automatically if you stick it in there. That Yushiro sure is skilled, creating something like this. A cat? So, you're the one who's going to deliver this to Miss Tamayo, huh? There, there. Thanks! Now you're all set. All right, take care now! Heyâ€” I was told that under Yushiro's spell, it would be invisible until it meowed, and then vanish again when it meowed a second time. So it's true, huh? Where are those two? I gotta search for them!
904;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Kyogai (Drum Demon);Demon;Male;My... writing...
905;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Kyogai's Lecture Man;Human;Male;Your writing is just so boring. Every last word is utter trash! No beauty, no fragility, no impact.
906;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Kyogai (Drum Demon);Demon;Male;It wasn't trash at all. At the very least, not to that kid. He saw fit not to trample on it.
907;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Rest in peace.
908;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Kyogai (Drum Demon);Demon;Male;Both my Blood Demon Art... and my tsuzumi playing... have been recognized.
909;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Kiyoshi! Teruko! Kiyoshi! Teruko! Kiyoshi! Teruko!
910;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Kiyoshi;Human;Male;Tanjiro...
911;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Why are you throwing stuff at me?
912;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Kiyoshi;Human;Male;We're so sorry! The tsuzumi vanished, so we panicked.
913;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I see. Well, I'm glad you're safe. You did a good job hanging in there. You, too, Kiyoshi. Come on, let's head outside. Climb onto my back. Is your leg okay?
914;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Kiyoshi;Human;Male;Yes!
915;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Tanjiro;Human;Male;You just have to be brave a little longer. I'm picking up Zenitsu and Shoichi's scent. They must be outside. Both of them safeâ€” I smell blood!
916;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Kiyoshi;Human;Male;What's wrong?
917;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Nothing. Let's hurry!
918;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Inosuke;Human;Male;Take this! Move it! Take this! Draw your sword and fight me! You spineless punk!
919;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Tanjiro... I protected it. Because you said... this was more important to you than your life. The thing is... I've always had really good hearing. One time, I knew what people said while I was asleep, and that creeped everyone out. I'm not hearing any more demon sounds. Tanjiro, you defeated that demon, didn't you? I can hear you guys, and also these weird-sounding, loud footsteps.
920;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Shoichi;Human;Male;...itsu! Zenitsu! Zenitsu! Thank goodness! Are you all right? When the room spun around, we got thrown outside. We fell from the second-story window.
921;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Did we now?
922;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Shoichi;Human;Male;You were protecting me, so I'm totally fine. But...
923;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Zenitsu;Human;Male;I'm glad to hear that. So, tell me, why all the tears? Now I get it! I fell right onto my head, didn't I?
924;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Shoichi;Human;Male;Yes.
925;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Am I gonna... Am I gonna die? My head is starting to spin. What's this? What's this? What's this?
926;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Inosuke;Human;Male;Comin' through! Comin' through!
927;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Zenitsu;Human;Male;There it is again! The monster boar!
928;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Inosuke;Human;Male;I'm getting a demonic vibe.
929;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Zenitsu;Human;Male;It's him! I was able to tell from his voice! He's the fifth survivor! During Final Selection, he was the first to rush up the mountain, and then he came down from the mountain before anyone else! Mr. Impatient!
930;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Inosuke;Human;Male;Hey, found it!
931;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Cut it out!
932;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Inosuke;Human;Male;Who the hell are you? Get out of the way!
933;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Zenitsu;Human;Male;I'm Zenitsu Agatsuma! I'm with the Demon Slayer Corps like you!
934;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Inosuke;Human;Male;Demon Slayer Corps? Then I shouldn't have to tell you! We gotta get rid of that thing! Now, get the hell out of my way!
935;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Zenitsu;Human;Male;I'm not moving! This is Tanjiro'sâ€”
936;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Inosuke;Human;Male;Don't argue with me! In that case, I'm gonna demolish him and the box together! I said move it! Why, you...
937;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Inside this box... Inside this box is something I'm not letting you touch! Something precious to Tanjiro!
938;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Inosuke;Human;Male;Oh, hey, come on! What are you talking about? There's a demon inside that box! Don't you get that?
939;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Zenitsu;Human;Male;I've known that from the very start! I knew he was traveling with a demon. Because the sounds demons make aren't anything like human sounds. But... I can pick up a sound so gentle and kind from Tanjiro, it makes me want to cry. So kind, I don't think I've ever heard anything like it before. All living creatures constantly give off sounds. The world is full of all these sounds spilling out. Breathing, heartbeats, the sound of blood circulating... By listening closely, I could tell what someone was thinking. But I've been deceived by others time and time again. I've always believed in whomever I wanted to believe in. Tanjiro, despite being a Demon Slayer, is traveling with a demon. But I'm sure he has a reason for that. And that it's a reason I can accept! I believe that! I... I'm going to ask Tanjiro directly myself! So, you... You can just back off!
940;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Inosuke;Human;Male;Let go of me, dammit! You're so annoying!
941;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Zenitsu;Human;Male;You're not laying a finger on that! That's something... precious to Tanjiro! You're not touching it until he gets back!
942;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Inosuke;Human;Male;Damn you! Take this! Move it!
943;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Zenitsu;Human;Male;I won't!
944;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Inosuke;Human;Male;Take this! Move it! Take this! Draw your sword and fight me! You spineless punk!
945;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Tanjiro... I protected it. Because you said... this was more important to you... than your life.
946;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Inosuke;Human;Male;After all that bluster, you won't even draw your sword, you dumbass? If you're a fellow Demon Slayer, then let's see you fight! If you're not gonna fight, get the hell out of my way! Move it! Enough! If you won't get out of my way, I'll just have to skewer you along with that box!
947;1;13;Something More Important Than Life;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Knock it off! Knock it off!
948;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;Take this! Move it! Take this! Draw your sword and fight me! You spineless punk! Enough! I'll just have to skewer you along with that box!
949;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Knock it off! Knock it off! Knock it off!
950;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;He broke his bones!
951;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Aren't you a member of the Demon Slayers Corps? Don't you get why Zenitsu refuses to draw his sword? It's because it's taboo for us to draw our swords on each other for no reason! But here you are, giving him a one-sided beatdown! Is that fun for you? You're the lowest of the low!
952;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;Oh, so that's why? My bad. In that case, let's fight barehanded.
953;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;No! I don't think you get it at all! First... We're not supposed to fight each other, period! Fighting barehanded doesn't make it all right! Listen to me!
954;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Look at him! How can he move like that? I mean, Tanjiro just busted some of his ribs. Actually, isn't Tanjiro running afoul of the taboo himself? He did break his bones.
955;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Th-This guy... His attacks are bizarrely low! It's just like... Just like... battling a four-legged beast! Target him low! Even lower than your opponent! The flexibility of his joints! It's superhuman!
956;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;Pretty amazing, aren't I? Pretty amazing, aren't I?
957;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;He said it twice! Singing his own praises...
958;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;And look what else I can do!
959;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Cut it out! Don't do stuff like that! Knock it off when you've got busted bones! It's gonna get worse!
960;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;Worse? Fine by me! Nothing can top the pleasure of this moment!
961;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;You need to think hard about the future!
962;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;What do I care?
963;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;You need to... calm down!
964;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;That sound! Are your skulls fractured? Huh? A girl? Huh? Your face! What the hell?
965;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;You've got a problem with my face or something?
966;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;You're one creepy guy, you know that? You've got such a ripped body, but there's a girl's face sitting on top of it.
967;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;Why the hell are you staring at my face like that?
968;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;I-I'm not! I'm not looking at your face!
969;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;We don't have a problem with your face! It's quite petite, fair-skinned, and therefore attractive!
970;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;You're a corpse! Come at me!
971;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Not happening! I'm not gonna attack you anymore!
972;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;Try head-butting me one more time!
973;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Nope, I'm done!
974;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;I said do it! Come on!
975;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;You sit yourself down! Are you okay?
976;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;Hey, Big Forehead! Let me tell you my name. It's Inosuke Hashibira! Don't you forget it!
977;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;What characters do you use to spell that?
978;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;Spell? Spell... I don't know how to read or write! That name is written on my loinclothâ€”
979;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;What's wrong?
980;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Shoichi;Human;Male;He froze.
981;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;What's the matter?
982;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;He collapsed! Is he dead?
983;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;He's not dead. It's probably a concussion. Because I head-butted the hell out of him.
984;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Teruko;Human;Female;Are you okay, Tanjiro?
985;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yeah.
986;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Teruko;Human;Female;Amazing! Can I touch your head?
987;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Here!
988;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;That's scary! Not a drop of blood from Tanjiro's head. How hard is it anyway? I mean, the wild boar's passed out.
989;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Teruko;Human;Female;Tanjiro, your head is so hard!
990;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;You think so?
991;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;He's awake!
992;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;Fight me! Fight me! Hey, you!
993;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;This is how he is when he wakes up? I hate that more than anything!
994;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;What the hell are you guys doing?
995;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;It's a burial. You help out, too, Inosuke. There are still people who were killed inside the house.
996;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;What's the point of burying the corpses of creatures? I'm not doing that! I'm not helping out! Forget that! Fight me!
997;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Man, he really is a loon. What does he mean, what's the point?
998;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I see. You can't do it because your wounds are hurting you.
999;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Those two are beyond help! They're both crazy!
1000;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;No, that's okay. After all, we all have a different pain threshold. Moving everyone who died outside that house, then burying them by covering them with dirt is a lot of work. Zenitsu and these kids and I will do our best, so don't worry!
1001;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Kiyoshi;Human;Male;He's so off.
1002;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Shoichi;Human;Male;He's so off.
1003;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;You should get some rest, Inosuke. Sorry to ask too much of you!
1004;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;Don't underestimate me, dammit! I'll bury a hundred, no, two hundred of your corpses! Just watch! I'm going to bury more than anyone of you!
1005;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Teruko;Human;Female;What is that person doing?
1006;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Kiyoshi;Human;Male;Better not look.
1007;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Shoichi;Human;Male;Yeah.
1008;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Crow;Bird;Bird;Descend the mountain! Descend the mountain!
1009;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Shoichi;Human;Male;That crow is talking!
1010;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Kiyoshi;Human;Male;Just don't think anymore.
1011;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Teruko;Human;Female;Okay.
1012;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Crow;Bird;Bird;All right, follow me! Follow yours truly!
1013;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;Hey! Where are you going?
1014;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;We're descending the mountain.
1015;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;We're not done with our battle yet!
1016;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;You're tired, aren't you? Come on, we're heading down.
1017;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;I'm not tired! Let's fight!
1018;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;I won't have it! I won't have it! I won't have it! You can't go, Shoichi! You're powerful, Shoichi! Shoichi is the one who's gonna protect me!
1019;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Can't you see Shoichi doesn't want to stay?
1020;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Please don't leave me behind!
1021;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;You stop that right now!
1022;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Crow;Bird;Bird;Hold out your hands! That will ward off demons. You with marechi, keep that on your person!
1023;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;It smells like wisteria.
1024;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Kiyoshi;Human;Male;Wisteria?
1025;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;It's a flower that demons can't abide. You should hold onto that.
1026;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Crow;Bird;Bird;Demon repellent! Demon repellent!
1027;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Kiyoshi;Human;Male;We're truly grateful! We can get home on our own.
1028;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Take care, now!
1029;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Crow;Bird;Bird;Now then, follow me! Follow yours truly!
1030;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;Fight me! I swear I'm gonna find a weak point and bring you down, loser!
1031;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;My name's not "loser"! It's Tanjiro Kamado!
1032;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;Gonpachiro Kamaboko! I'm gonna bring you down!
1033;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Who the hell are you talking about?
1034;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;- That would be you!
1035;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;- No, it's someone else!
1036;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Can you talk any louder?
1037;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;A wisteria family crest...
1038;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Crow;Bird;Bird;Rest time! Rest time! Since you've sustained injuries, you're to rest until you're fully recovered!
1039;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;You sure it's okay to rest? I just fought a demon while injured, you know.
1040;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Crow;Bird;Bird;Ke-ke-ke.
1041;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Ke-ke-ke?
1042;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;Let's eat this thing.
1043;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Crow;Bird;Bird;What?
1044;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Old Lady Wisteria;Human;Female;Yes?
1045;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Sorry to bother you so late at night!
1046;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;A monster! It's a monster!
1047;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Hey you!
1048;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;Who the hell are you?
1049;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Old Lady Wisteria;Human;Female;I see you're a demon hunter.
1050;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;You look pretty weak!
1051;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Hey!
1052;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Old Lady Wisteria;Human;Female;Come in.
1053;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;That old lady sure walks fast!
1054;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Old Lady Wisteria;Human;Female;This is where you'll be staying. A change of clothes. And here is your meal.
1055;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;She has to be a monster, Tanjiro! That old lady's a monster! She's so quick, it's eerie! She's a monster! A monster hagâ€” Use your chopsticks.
1056;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;If you're that hungry, you can have this, too. Here.
1057;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;No!
1058;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;He's totally forgotten about the box! Gimme a break, you thug! Moron! Eyelashes!
1059;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Old Lady Wisteria;Human;Female;Your bedding.
1060;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;There she is! The monster hagâ€”
1061;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;First come, first served! I'm taking this one!
1062;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;That's fine. Sleep wherever you want. Where do you want to sleep, Zenitsu?
1063;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Old Lady Wisteria;Human;Female;Here is the doctor.
#N/A
1065;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Who would've guessed that all three of us had broken ribs?
1066;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;This knot hurts more than my ribs.
1067;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Sorry.
1068;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Hey, you'd better apologize. It really hurt, you know. Getting pounded to a pulp like that. Say you're sorry.
1069;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;I'll pass.
1070;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Say you're sorry!
1071;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;I'll pass!
1072;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Just say you're sorry!
1073;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;If you're gonna be like that, we're not eating with you anymore.
1074;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;What's up with that?
1075;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Meals always taste better when you eat together, you know.
1076;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;He's right about that.
1077;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;Did you guys hurt your heads or something?
1078;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Who are you to talk?
1079;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Old Lady Wisteria;Human;Female;Is there something I can help you with?
1080;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Monster!
1081;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Hey! According to the crow, this house with the wisteria family crest belongs to a family that was once rescued by demon hunters. That's why they take care of people for free if they're demon hunters. That's what I was told, but I never thought they'd show us this much hospitality.
1082;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;Just how great is the Demon Slayers Corps?
1083;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Now that you mention it, Inosuke, why did you join the Corps? You had some kind of reason, didn't you?
1084;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;A member of the Demon Slayers Corps barged in on me on my mountain, so we competed to see who was stronger, and I seized his sword.
1085;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;What an unfortunate soul.
1086;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;And then, I heard there was something called "Final Selection," and the fact that demons do exist.
1087;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;So that's why you joined the Demon Slayers Corps? And hey, so you and I both grew up in the mountains, huh?
1088;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;Don't lump me in with you! I don't have any parents or siblings! Testing my strength against other living creatures is my only pleasure!
1089;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Is that right? Is that right?
1090;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Tanjiro, no one else is asking, so I'm gonna ask myself. Why are you traveling with a demon?
1091;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Zenitsu... You knew about that and still protected the box, huh? You really are a great guy, you know that? Thanks!
1092;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;You... You really shouldn't heap so much praise on me!
1093;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I've got a keen sense of smell. I knew it from the start. How kind you are, Zenitsu... and how strong...
1094;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;No, I'm not strong. Don't give me that. I haven't forgiven you for stopping me from bringing Shoichi along. It's trying to come out! It's trying to come out!
1095;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;It's all right.
1096;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;How can it be all right? Huh? Huh?
1097;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Shush! It's the middle of the night, Zenitsu!
1098;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;Why won't he take the bait? Even when I stole his food... Come to think of it, why did he get mad a couple of times? I forgot.
1099;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Oh my gosh! It's not even locked? P-P-Protect me! Someone please protect me! Even you'll do, Inosuke!
1100;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;Stay away from me!
1101;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;It's out! I gotta hide! I'm so scared!
1102;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Nezuko!
1103;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Inosuke;Human;Male;That's too much thinking.
1104;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Zenitsu... Nezuko's myâ€”
1105;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Tanjiro... Listen to me.
1106;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Z-Zenitsu?
1107;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Listen to me. Just who do you think you are? So, you've been traveling with a girl this cute? With a girl this cute in tow, day after day, you've been traveling, and you've been on cloud nine the whole time, huh?
1108;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Zenitsu, it's not likeâ€”
1109;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Give me back all the blood I shed! I... Listen, I... I didn't give it my all just so you could spend time in la-la land, making out with a girl! That's not why I got pummeled and kicked by that weird wild boar, right?
1110;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Zenitsu, calm down! What's gotten into you all of a sudden?
1111;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Demon Slayer Corps is not something you'd join for fun! Guys like you gotta be purged! Immediately! Come to think of it, there's also the crime of thwarting my marriage and sending Shoichi home. Purged immediately! Don't ever underestimate the Corps! A guy like you! A guy like you!
1112;1;14;The House with the Wisteria Family Crest;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Zenitsu, cut it out!
1113;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Tanjiro... Listen to me... Demon Slayer Corps is not something you'd join for fun! Guys like you gotta be purged! Immediately! Don't ever underestimate the Corps! Nezuko! Nezuko! Nezuko! Nezuko!
1114;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Zenitsu! Stop following her already!
1115;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Tan... ji... ro! Let's be friends, Tanjiro!
1116;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Zenitsu! Don't keep chasing us! I beg you!
1117;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Oh, don't be like that, Tanjiro! Nezuko! - Tanjiro!
1118;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;- Stop!
1119;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Nezuko! Tanjiro!
1120;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Inosuke;Human;Male;Man, I'm hungry.
1121;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Old Lady Wisteria;Human;Female;Pardon me, sir. Those clothes of yours are quite soiled, I see. I'll clean them for you, so please wear these in the meanwhile. These are pleasant to the touch and quite comfortable. How does tempura for dinner sound? You know, something covered with batter and fried.
1122;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Hey, wait up! Come back here, Nezuko!
1123;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Wh-What was that for? Hold up! Hold up! Stop chasing us, Inosuke!
1124;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Tanjiro!
#N/A
1126;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Crow;Bird;Bird;North-northeast! North-northeast! Your next mission is north-northeast! The three of you are to go to Mt. Natagumo! Head to Mt. Natagumo!
1127;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;We're heading out now. Thank you for everything.
1128;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Old Lady Wisteria;Human;Female;Now then, for good luck.
1129;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Thank you so much!
1130;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Inosuke;Human;Male;What do you think you're doing, old hag?
1131;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Zenitsu;Human;Male;What are you, a moron? She's striking sparks for good luck! It's a purification ceremony! Because we're gonna go on a dangerous mission!
1132;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Old Lady Wisteria;Human;Female;Always live your lives with great pride. I wish you luck in battle!
1133;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Inosuke;Human;Male;Great pride? "Luck in battle"? What does that mean?
1134;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Jeez, this guy is totally clueless.
1135;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Well, yeah, now that you mention it, it's kind of difficult. With great pride... I guess it means that you know your place and that you behave properly so that you're never ashamed of yourself. And the old lady is also praying for our safety.
1136;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Inosuke;Human;Male;So, what is this "place"? What do you mean, "never ashamed"?
1137;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Well, it's...
1138;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Inosuke;Human;Male;What exactly does it mean to "behave properly"? Why in the hell would that old hag pray for our safety anyway? She has nothing to do with us. Then, why? She has no clue what her own place is, does she?
1139;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Zenitsu;Human;Male;He sped up!
1140;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Inosuke;Human;Male;I won't get beat!
1141;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Wait up! Hold up! Would you mind waiting a second?
1142;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Zenitsu? What's wrong?
1143;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Zenitsu;Human;Male;I'm scared, all right? Now that we're nearing our destination, I'm so scared!
1144;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Inosuke;Human;Male;Why the hell is he sitting? How creepy is that?
1145;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Who are you to talk, Pig Face? Don't tell me you're not getting any vibes from that mountain!
1146;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Still, what good will it do to just sit there?
1147;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Inosuke;Human;Male;I told you, he's creepy.
1148;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Zenitsu;Human;Male;I am not in any way creepy! I'm normal! I'm the normal one! You guys are abnormal! What? What's wrong? Hey...
1149;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;What is this smell?
1150;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Tanjiro! Come on! Don't leave me here by myself! Don't leave me!
1151;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Demon Slayer 1;Human;Male;H-Help me.
1152;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;He's got our uniform on! He's a Demon Slayer! Something must've happened!
1153;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Hold up!
1154;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Are you all right? What happened?
1155;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Demon Slayer 1;Human;Male;They were attached to me, too! Help me!
1156;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'm going.
1157;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Inosuke;Human;Male;I'll go on ahead. You can follow me, shivering. This is making me hungry.
1158;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Inosuke...
1159;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Zenitsu;Human;Male;This is challenging enough for you, right?
1160;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Inosuke;Human;Male;Let's go! What the hell is this?
1161;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;A spider web?
1162;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Inosuke;Human;Male;Jeez, this place is full of spider webs! What a pain!
1163;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;You're right. Inosuke?
1164;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Inosuke;Human;Male;What do you want?
1165;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Thanks. You said you'd come with me, and I felt encouraged. That twisted, ominous scent I was picking up from the mountain... It made me freeze a little. Thanks!
1166;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Old Lady Wisteria;Human;Female;These are pleasant to the touch and quite comfortable. Always live your lives with great pride. I wish you luck in battle!
1167;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Inosuke... Let's go. We've come for backup. I'm Tanjiro Kamado, Rank Mizunoto.
1168;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Murata;Human;Male;Mizunoto... Mizunoto? Why didn't they send a Hashira? No matter how many Mizunoto they send, it won't help! It's pointless!
1169;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Inosuke!
1170;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Inosuke;Human;Male;Shut up! As far as pointlessness goes, your existence itself has no point at all! Now, tell us what's going on, you spineless fool!
1171;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Murata;Human;Male;Who the hell is this guy? Did you forget that I have seniority? Th-The crow gave us the order! And ten of us Demon Slayers came here. Not long after we entered the mountain, the Slayers... The Slayers started killing each other! I... I...
1172;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Master Ubuyashiki;Human;Male;You did well to return. So, most of my children have been slaughtered? We might find the Twelve Kizuki there, then. It seems I'll have to send in some Hashiras. Giyu... Shinobu...
1173;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;- As you wish!
1174;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;- As you wish! If only humans and demons could get along. Don't you agree, Tomioka?
1175;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;Impossible... as long as demons eat humans.
1176;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Zenitsu;Human;Male;I wonder if they hate me. Would you really leave your friend by the roadside? Wouldn't you talk him through it if you were friends? If they both tried to talk me into going,
1177;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Zenitsu...
1178;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Inosuke;Human;Male;Zenitsu...
1179;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Zenitsu;Human;Male;I would've gone, okay? Sure I would. But no, off they went on their merry way up that scary mountain. Poor me left alone here...
1180;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Sparrow;Bird;Bird;Sulking isn't going to do you any good. You have to go help your friends now."
1181;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Lucky you, you don't have a care in the world. You don't understand a thing about humans, do you? Ouch, ouch, ouch! You're not cute at all! I mean it! Not that side of you! Seriously, you've got zero charm! I mean, look how cute Nezuko is, and she's a demon! But you're a sparrow, and you're so vicious! He took Nezuko with him! Why did he have to take my precious Nezuko with him? Damn Tanjiro! Don't take a young girl into danger! Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! Nezuko!
1182;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;What is this sound?
1183;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Murata;Human;Male;There it is again. It's this sound again! I heard this sound, and the next thing I knew, everyone started killing each other!
1184;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Where's it coming from?
1185;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Inosuke;Human;Male;These guys are all morons! They don't know that it's taboo for us Demon Slayers to fight each other!
1186;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;No, that's not it! They're not moving normally! They're being manipulated by something!
1187;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Inosuke;Human;Male;All right. I'm gonna slash them to ribbons!
1188;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;You can't do that! They're alive! Some of them are still alive! Besides, we can't harm the corpses of our teammates!
1189;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Inosuke;Human;Male;Stop denying me at every turn!
1190;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;A strange sweet scent from his back! It's threads! They're being manipulated by threads! Slash the threads!
1191;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Inosuke;Human;Male;I already knew that before you caught on!
1192;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Where's the location of the demon controlling them? What's this? What an irritating odor! Though it was just for a second! What's this? Spiders! So, the spiders are attaching them to the puppet strings? That means...
1193;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Spider Demon Mother;Demon;Female;Now then, my sweet little dolls... Dance until your arms and legs fall off.
1194;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;It's not good enough to just cut the threads! The spiders are just gonna stick more puppet strings onto them! So... That acrid smell again! What is it anyway? It's being carried here by the wind!
1195;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Inosuke;Human;Male;So, all we gotta do is kill those damn spiders, huh?
1196;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;That would be impossible! Those spiders are tiny, and I'm sure there are tons of them! We gotta find the demon who's controlling them! It's no good, Inosuke! Inosuke, if you have some kind of power that can pinpoint the demon's location, then help me out! This weird smell has been flowing in, and my nose isn't working great! And also, um...
1197;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Murata;Human;Male;It's Murata!
1198;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Murata! Murata and I will find a way to deal with the people being controlled! Inosuke, you...
1199;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Don't disturb my family's peaceful life.
1200;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;He's floating! No. He's standing on the threads! What did he mean by "family"?
1201;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Mother will kill you all right away.
1202;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Mother?
1203;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Inosuke;Human;Male;Damn you! Where the hell do you think you're going? Fight me! Fightâ€”
1204;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Inosuke!
1205;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Inosuke;Human;Male;Why did he show up anyway?
1206;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Tanjiro;Human;Male;That kid probably isn't the demon pulling the puppet strings! So, first, let's...
1207;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Inosuke;Human;Male;Okay, okay, okay! I hear you, all right? You want me to find where that demon's at, right? Shut up already, Forehead! Beast Breathing Seventh Form, Spatial Awareness! Found it! There you are!
1208;1;15;Mount Natagumo;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;I won't let anyone get in our way. The five of us are going to live in bliss as a family. No one can break our bond.
1209;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Inosuke;Human;Male;Beast Breathing Seventh Form, Spatial Awareness!
1210;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Found it?
1211;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Inosuke;Human;Male;Yeah! That way! I'm picking up a powerful vibe from over there!
1212;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;You are? Way to go, Inosuke!
1213;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Inosuke;Human;Male;We gotta take care of these guys or we'll never get anywhere!
1214;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Damn. Isn't there... Isn't there any way at all?
1215;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Ne... Ne... Nezu... Ne... Whe... Whe... Wh-Whe... Whe... Where are you?
1216;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Inosuke;Human;Male;Dammit! What a pain in the ass! I'm just gonna demolish them all at once!
1217;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;You can't do that! Back off! There has to be a way! So, let's try not to hurt theseâ€” Murata?
1218;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Murata;Human;Male;Leave these guys to me and go on ahead!
1219;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Inosuke;Human;Male;What kind of talk is that, Mr. Pissed-My-Pants?
1220;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Murata;Human;Male;I never pissed my pants, you stupid boar! I wasn't talking to you, so you can just shut up! I know that wasn't my finest moment back there, but I'm a Demon Slayer, too! I'll find a way to hold them off! Now I know I just need to slash the threads, and that these guys can only make the most elementary movements! I'll watch out for the spiders, too! There has to be people under even more control closer to the demon! So, you two go on!
1221;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Understood! We appreciate this! Let's go, Inosuke!
1222;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Inosuke;Human;Male;Hey, let go of me, dammit! I wanna pound that guy's face first! Who's he calling "a stupid boar"?
1223;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Murata;Human;Male;Would you shut up? Just drop it and get out of here!
1224;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Inosuke;Human;Male;I'm so gonna punch you when I get back! Dammit! I'm gonna punch that guy if it's the last thing I do!
1225;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Stop talking like that!
1226;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Inosuke;Human;Male;He called me "a stupid boar," okay, Monjiro?
1227;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;It's "Tanjiro"! So, anyway, we're heading the right way, right?
1228;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Inosuke;Human;Male;My senses never lie! But... what the hell are these annoying threads?
1229;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;That's how close we're getting to the demon!
1230;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Inosuke;Human;Male;Here's another bunch.
1231;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Demon Slayer 2;Human;Female;No. Don't come any closer. Please summon someone of higher rank! Otherwise, everyone will get killed! Please. Please!
1232;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Spider Demon Mother;Demon;Female;I wonder if you can defeat them. The closer you get to me, the thicker and stronger these threads are, and the more powerful my dolls become.
1233;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Mother... You can win, right?
1234;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Spider Demon Mother;Demon;Female;Rui...
1235;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Don't you think this is taking too much time? You'd better hurry up or I'm gonna tell Father.
1236;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Spider Demon Mother;Demon;Female;I can do it! I can do it, all right? I promise to protect you! So, please! Not your father! Don't tell your father! Just not him!
1237;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Then, hurry it up.
1238;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Spider Demon Mother;Demon;Female;Die! Die! Just die already! Or else there'll be hell for me to pay!
1239;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Demon Slayer 2;Human;Female;Run!
1240;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;So fast!
1241;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Demon Slayer 2;Human;Female;I'm being controlled, so my movements aren't my own at all! I was never this strong!
1242;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;The demon's forcing her to move her body with the threads, so it doesn't care if her bones get broken! So cruel!
1243;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Spider Demon Mother;Demon;Female;So stubborn! How about this?
1244;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;This sound!
1245;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Demon Slayer 3;Human;Male;P-Please kill me! My arms and legs... The bones are piercing my inner organs! Every time I'm forced to move, the pain's intense! I can't take it anymore! Either way, I'll die. So, please help me! Please deliver the finishing blow!
1246;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Inosuke;Human;Male;Sure, you got it!
1247;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Hold upâ€” Hold up, will you? We gotta find a way to help him!
1248;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Inosuke;Human;Male;Oh, shut up! You really need to shut up!
1249;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;But...
1250;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Inosuke;Human;Male;He's asking us to kill him, all right? These guys are speedy, too. If we get caught napping, we're gonna go down!
1251;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I know that! Let me think! Just hold up a second! I don't want to use any attacks. But even if we slash the threads, they'll only get reattached! To stop them from moving... I know!
1252;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Inosuke;Human;Male;Hey! Hey!
1253;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Good! She's following me!
1254;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Inosuke;Human;Male;Hey, why are you running around in circles like that? Quit fooling around!
1255;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Total Concentration...
1256;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Demon Slayer 2;Human;Female;Unbelievable strength!
1257;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;All right! You're all tangled up like I planned!
1258;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Inosuke;Human;Male;Wha... What's up with that? I wanna do that, too! Take this! You see that? I can do whatever you can do!
1259;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;My bad! I kind of missed it!
1260;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Inosuke;Human;Male;What?
1261;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I mean, you can't really blame me!
1262;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Spider Demon Mother;Demon;Female;Damn! They're all such useless dolls! I have no choice but to unleash that doll, then.
1263;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Nezuko! Nezuko! Where are you? Nezuko... Tanjiro... Wild Boar... Chuntaro! Where did you all go? I'm sorry for everything, okay? Chuntaro? You mean you came after me? You're so adorable! Second only to Nezuko, but still! I'm sorry for everything! All right, let's go look for Nezuko together!
1264;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Inosuke;Human;Male;Just look at that! Check it out! I've tossed up more than you!
1265;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Right! One more to go!
1266;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Inosuke;Human;Male;Okay. I'm gonna do it one more time, so make sure you watch!
1267;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;You got it! That's okay! Just try not to be violent!
1268;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Spider Demon Mother;Demon;Female;I don't need those fragile human dolls anymore! They're useless! They're useless!
1269;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Inosuke;Human;Male;Dammit! Now they're all dead!
1270;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Let's go.
1271;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Inosuke;Human;Male;Yeah, good idea. This way! I'm gonna catch up to 'em soon!
1272;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Now that the wind's changed direction, my sense of smell is starting to come back! So, I'll be able to pinpoint the demon's location! There are two more scents! There! Inosuke!
1273;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Inosuke;Human;Male;I detected that thing before you did! I'm gonna hack its head right off! That thing... has no head!
1274;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Nezuko! Where are you? Where the hell are you, Tanjiro, Inosuke? Don't just leave me here all by myself in this terrifying forest! What was that? You know what? This is starting to make me really mad! I'll find Nezuko as soon as possible, and then it's so long, scary forest! Nezuko!
1275;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Inosuke;Human;Male;That thing's got no weak spots! I can't slash something that's not there!
1276;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Inosuke!
1277;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Inosuke;Human;Male;What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
1278;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Calm down! We'll inflict a monk's robe cut on it! Let's try slashing from the base of its neck on the right side to his left waist! It's a lot to cover, and I'm sure it's really tough, but I bet... Hold up! In unison...
1279;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Inosuke;Human;Male;It's fast! But not so fast I can't dodge it! Crap! I forgot about the spiders! I can't move! I'm a dead man!
1280;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Inosuke, let's fight together! Let's think together! Let's work together so we can bring down this demon!
1281;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Inosuke;Human;Male;Damn you! Don't make me any giddier than I already am! You're in my way!
1282;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Inosuke, launch yourself off me! Inosuke, jump! Total Concentration... Water Breathing! Fourth Form... Striking Tide! Now for the monk's robe cut!
1283;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Inosuke;Human;Male;Dammit, what the hell? This is annoying! It's all going his way, huh? It's like this was preordained or something! Flowing as naturally as the water from a river... It's not about going first for this guy. It's the battle! It's the overall flow that he's watching!
1284;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Great! He cut it just right! All right! You defeated it, Inosuke! Inosuke?
1285;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Inosuke;Human;Male;Anything you can do, I can do, too, dumbass!
1286;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;This scent... So, that's what this is about, huh, Inosuke?
1287;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Spider Demon Mother;Demon;Female;They got me! They got me! Even though that doll was my fastest and strongest! It's Rui's fault for coming to me with his threats! That's why I panicked! I panicked! Panicked! From above?
1288;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Water Breathing, First Form!
1289;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Spider Demon Mother;Demon;Female;He'll kill me! He'll chop off my head! Think! You have to think! But... if I die, I'll be released. And then, I'll know peace.
1290;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Fifth Form... Blessed Rain After the Drought!
1291;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Spider Demon Mother;Demon;Female;This is... It feels like I'm being showered by a gentle rain. It doesn't hurt at all. It's not agonizing. I just feel warm. I never dreamed that my end would be this tranquil. And now, I'll be released. I'm so sorry! I apologize, so please forgive me! What made you angry? What caused you such displeasure?
1292;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;It's your own fault for not realizing what made him mad.
1293;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Spider Demon Mother;Demon;Female;But how could I?
1294;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Spider Demon Brother;Demon;Male;Mom's in trouble with Dad again!
1295;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Spider Demon Mother;Demon;Female;Stop it! No! No! Those eyes... Such kind eyes... Back when I was human, I think someone used to look at me with kind eyes. I wonder who that was. I can't remember. It was someone who always treasured me. I wonder how that person is doing now. There's a member of the Twelve Kizuki here.
1296;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Wait!
1297;1;16;Letting Someone Else Go First;Spider Demon Mother;Demon;Female;Be careful.
1298;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Tanjiro;Human;Male;The blood of the Twelve Kizuki should have a high degree of Kibutsuji's blood. If I can extract it, the medicine that will turn Nezuko back into a human can be completed sooner! Hold on! Inosuke!
1299;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Inosuke;Human;Male;So, did you defeat it?
1300;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Are you all right, Inosuke?
1301;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Inosuke;Human;Male;I asked you whether you defeated that thing or not!
1302;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Uh, yeah, I did! But anyway, Inosuke, how are you feeling?
1303;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Inosuke;Human;Male;Don't go showering me with your sensitivity and kindness! You hear me? Got that? After all, anything you can do, I can do, too! Before you know it, my head will be harder than yours! Not to mention... Not to mention... Um...
1304;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Tanjiro;Human;Male;He's wounded severely. I couldn't save our other friends, either. That person gave off the scent of terror and suffering. Enough to make her yearn for death. What's the deal with this mountain anyway? With one of the Twelve Kizuki present... Stay still, Inosuke!
1305;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Inosuke;Human;Male;Cut that out! I don't need that!
1306;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Tanjiro;Human;Male;...and a demon family living here...
1307;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Inosuke;Human;Male;I'm totally fine!
1308;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Tanjiro;Human;Male;But... I thought demons never herded together!
1309;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Ouch! Something just pricked me! What the hell? This is so annoying! I can't find Tanjiro and Inosuke anywhere! This sucks! Where did they go? Which way? And it stinks around here, too! Stinks! I think I'm gonna cry! And this sound of spiders rustling around is so creepy! I'm sure these spiders are doing their best to survive, too, but still! Dammit! Shut up! Just stay still! Is this even possible? That's a spider with a human face! What's up with that? What's up with that? Please be a dream! Please be a dream! Please be a dream! If this can just be a dream, I promise to do my best! If I wake up to find myself resting my head on Nezuko's lap, then I promise to give it all I have! I'll even plow fields! I'll be glad to plow a whole acre, no, even two acres! So, please! Let me wake up from this nightmare! What the heck is that? Are those humans who got turned into spiders? Is that house floating? I can see a glimpse of something, but are those threads? And it really stinks! Talk about pungent! This would kill Tanjiro with his keen sense of smell! This smell is making my throat ache! I'm tearing up! My eyes hurt, too! It's huge! It's huge! It's huge! It's so huge! That thing is too huge! You know what! I refuse to speak with anyone like you!
1310;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Spider Demon Brother;Demon;Male;It's no use running away. You're already losing.
1311;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Zenitsu;Human;Male;What are you muttering about? I don't wanna hear it, so stop talking to me! I don't like guys like you, all right?
1312;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Spider Demon Brother;Demon;Male;You already know how dire your situation is, don't you?
1313;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Zenitsu;Human;Male;What are you talking about?
1314;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Spider Demon Brother;Demon;Male;Take a look at your hands.
1315;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Zenitsu;Human;Male;My hands? What's wrong with my handsâ€” What's this?
1316;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Spider Demon Brother;Demon;Male;It's poison. You got bitten by a spider, right? That poison will turn you into a spider, too. In another 30 minutes, you'll be my slave, crawling all over the ground! Look at this. It's a clock. Do you understand? By the time this long hand goes around once, you'll have become a member of the spider clan! When the needle arrives here, you'll start to feel tingling and pain in your limbs. When it's here, you'll also feel dizzy and nauseous! Here, you'll experience intense pain, your body will start to shrink, and you'll black out! And by the time you wake up... Running away...
1317;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Zenitsu;Human;Male;...is futile! Right, right, right! I know that, all right? I know that!
1318;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Spider Demon Brother;Demon;Male;What do you think you're doing?
1319;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Shut up! Just shut up!
1320;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Spider Demon Brother;Demon;Male;There's no need to be afraid. Once the poison makes its rounds and you turn into a spider, you'll lose all intelligence, too!
1321;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Zenitsu;Human;Male;No! That's just what I don't like about this! Why can't you understand that, huh? I have no friends or girlfriend, all right? No one will like me!
1322;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Spider Demon Brother;Demon;Male;Huh! I can see that you want an extra dose of poison to turn into a spider faster.
1323;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Zenitsu;Human;Male;No! No! I don't want to turn into that!
1324;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Jigoro;Human;Male;Get a hold of yourself! Stop crying! Stop running away! Doing that won't get you anywhere! Zenitsu! Come down from there! We're going to continue training!
1325;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Oh no! I'm sure I'll die if I do any more training! I'm sure that I'll die, so...
1326;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Jigoro;Human;Male;You won't die! Not from this level of training! Come down from there, you little moron!
1327;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Gramps!
1328;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Jigoro;Human;Male;Call me "Master"!
1329;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Zenitsu;Human;Male;But I love you, Gramps! When the girl I loved made me raise money so she could run off with another guy, you did rescue me from my mountain of debt! Well, maybe all you wanted was to train a swordsman! I want to live up to your expectations, too! But it's totally beyond me! I do feel terrible about the fact that I'm like this! Just so you know, I've been training on my own in secret, too! I haven't been getting any sleep! But I have absolutely nothing to show for it! What does this mean? I mean, really, what does this mean?
1330;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Jigoro;Human;Male;Calm down, Zenitsu! You do have the ability to...
1331;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Zenitsu;Human;Male;I've had enough!
1332;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Jigoro;Human;Male;Zenitsu!
1333;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Zenitsu;Human;Male;How tragic is my life anyway? I got hit by lightning. My hair color changed. I was thankful just to be alive, but... I... I hate myself more than anyone else. I always think I have to get my act together, but I end up cowering, running away, sniveling. I want to change. I want to be a competent person. Even still! I'm doing everything I can, all right? So, why do I have to end up going bald and turning into a monster? It can't be true, right? It so can't be true!
1334;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Spider Demon Brother;Demon;Male;What's up with this guy?
1335;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Oh, crap! Don't climb up here! Just leave me alone for a minute! Just for a minute, all right? My hair's falling out already? My hair is falling out. Hey, he never mentioned that part to me!
1336;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Spider Demon Brother;Demon;Male;Who is this guy? Isn't he a demon hunter who came here to kill our family? Did he just faint? I can't believe how spineless he is. He's gonna fall onto his head and die. What the hell?
1337;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Thunder Breathing, First Form.
1338;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Spider Demon Brother;Demon;Male;Poison Sputum! Did he just twist his body in midair to dodge that? Such quick reflexes! It's like he's a totally different person!
1339;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Thunder Breathing, First Form.
1340;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Spider Demon Brother;Demon;Male;Hey, you guys! Pounce on him!
1341;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Thunder Breathing, First Form.
1342;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Spider Demon Brother;Demon;Male;He's been assuming the same stance over and over. No question about it. This guy... is only capable of that one attack!
1343;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Jigoro;Human;Male;That's all right, Zenitsu. That's good enough for you. If you can master one, that's cause for celebration! If you can only do one thing, hone it to perfection. Hone it to the utmost limit!
1344;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Hey, but Gramps... Just a little while ago, you were hopping mad. Because Thunder Breathing has three forms, and all I can manage to do is one.
1345;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Jigoro;Human;Male;Do you know how to forge a sword?
1346;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Zenitsu;Human;Male;I have no idea. Will you keep hitting me? I think I'll cry.
1347;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Jigoro;Human;Male;The thing about swords... You strike and strike and strike to get rid of impurities and anything you don't need, and to increase the purity of the blade, so a durable sword can be forged.
1348;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Zenitsu;Human;Male;So that's why you keep clobbering me day in, day out? But I'm not made of steel, am I? I'm living flesh, you know.
1349;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Spider Demon Brother;Demon;Male;You're not much of a threat, are you? You call yourself a demon hunter? Any minute now, you'll be rendered immobile by that poison.
1350;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Jigoro;Human;Male;Zenitsu, perfect it! It's all right to cry. It's all right to run away! Just don't ever give up! Just believe. You endured all that hellish training! You'll be rewarded for that without fail! Hone it to the utmost limit! Become the most durable blade of all! Hone that one thing to perfection!
1351;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Kaigaku;Human;Male;Get out of my sight. Don't make me repeat myself. Get out of my sight. You know what I'm talking about. Aren't you ashamed of crying like a baby all day long? You laggard... Any time spent on you is wasted. Sensei is an extraordinary man.
1352;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Zenitsu;Human;Male;But Gramps saidâ€”
1353;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Kaigaku;Human;Male;Gramps? Don't speak of him in that familiar way! Sensei is a former Hashira! Someone who earned the highest title in the Demon Slayer Corps! Almost no one ever gets the chance to be trained by a former Hashira! The time Sensei spends training you is all for nothing! You're an eyesore, okay? Get out of my sight! Why are you here? Why do you insist on clinging here?
1354;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Zenitsu;Human;Male;I have no parents, so no one has any hopes for me. There's no one who dreams that I'll grasp or accomplish something one day. That I'll prove myself useful to somebody. That I'll manage to protect somebody and make that person happy, just once in my life. Not even a simple future like that. There's no one who hopes that I'll have one. If you fail, cry and run away even once, they say, "Oh, this guy's no good," and they walk away. But not Gramps! Time and time again, he steadfastly reprimanded me. All those times I kept running away... Time and time again... He'd drag me right back. Clearly, he did smack me around a bit too much. But he never abandoned me!
1355;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Spider Demon Brother;Demon;Male;Pierce him! Inject him with more poison! That should do it for him! What's this? The air is vibrating.
1356;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Thunder Breathing, First Form... Thunderclap and Flash! Sixfold!
1357;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Spider Demon Brother;Demon;Male;He vanished? Did I get slashed? Me? Slashed? By him? By a guy like him? But that's absurd! By a guy who can barely move his arms and legs?
1358;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Dream... It's a happy dream. I'm powerful. More powerful than anyone. I can help the weak and anyone in trouble. Anytime. Everything that Gramps taught me, all the time he spent on me... It wasn't for nothing! A dream that, thanks to Gramps, I became powerful and helped out a lot of people. But now, it's all over! Chuntaro... I'm so sorry.
1359;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Jigoro;Human;Male;Don't ever give up!
1360;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Don't ever give up. Use the breathing technique to slow down the poison as much as you can. Even if it's painful, even if it's agonizing, don't try to take the easy way out... or Gramps is gonna let you have it! Right. And Tanjiro's gonna yell at you, too.
1361;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Tanjiro;Human;Male;What was that sound? Did lightning just strike?
1362;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Inosuke;Human;Male;How should I know?
1363;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Tanjiro;Human;Male;But I'm not smelling any thunderclouds. The acrid odor in the air is stronger now, so I can't tell. Inosuke! I think I'll go that way.
1364;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Inosuke;Human;Male;Go ahead and do whatever you want!
1365;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Are you descending, Inosuke? Are you going down the mountain?
1366;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Inosuke;Human;Male;Why would I? Just beat it!
1367;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Tanjiro;Human;Male;No, no, because you're severely wounded.
1368;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Inosuke;Human;Male;I am not wounded at all!
1369;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Tanjiro;Human;Male;N-N-No, Inosuke! Your injuries... Anyone can see that... A demon! Because of the odor wafting all over this mountain, I couldn't pick it up at all!
1370;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Inosuke;Human;Male;I'm gonna tear you to shreds, you damn demon! Come back here, dammit!
1371;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Inosuke!
1372;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Spider Demon Sister;Demon;Female;Father!
1373;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Inosuke;Human;Male;Who are you calling "father"?
1374;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Inosuke!
1375;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Spider Demon Father;Demon;Male;Don't come near my family! Stay away!
1376;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Spider Demon Sister;Demon;Female;I'm leaving the rest to you, Father.
1377;1;17;You Must Master a Single Thing;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Water Breathing, Second Form! Water Wheel!
1378;1;18;A Forged Bond;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Were you acquainted with any of them? There don't seem to be any survivors around here. We were advised that several rookie Mizunoto had joined the battle, but they might be dead by now, don't you think?
1379;1;18;A Forged Bond;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;Let's go.
1380;1;18;A Forged Bond;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Isn't the Moon lovely? Since we've been given this joint mission, let's try to get along.
1381;1;18;A Forged Bond;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;I'm only here to slay some demons.
1382;1;18;A Forged Bond;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;How callous of you! All right, then, let's split up here. I shall proceed from the west.
1383;1;18;A Forged Bond;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;Agreed.
1384;1;18;A Forged Bond;Spider Demon Father;Demon;Male;Don't come near my family! Stay away!
1385;1;18;A Forged Bond;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Water Breathing, Second Form! Water Wheel! It's no good! The blade won't go through!
1386;1;18;A Forged Bond;Inosuke;Human;Male;So hard!
1387;1;18;A Forged Bond;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I can't slash him even if I use an attack! What should I do? What should I do?
1388;1;18;A Forged Bond;Spider Demon Father;Demon;Male;Don't come near my family! Stay away!
1389;1;18;A Forged Bond;Inosuke;Human;Male;What are you looking at? I'm over here! Curse you! Ouch! All that force with just one swipe of its arm! It's no good! I'm not at full power! Not to mention, the bleeding's making me stumble!
1390;1;18;A Forged Bond;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Water Breathing, Second Form... Improved, Lateral Water Wheel!
1391;1;18;A Forged Bond;Inosuke;Human;Male;What was that? What's going on?
1392;1;18;A Forged Bond;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Inosuke! You okay?
1393;1;18;A Forged Bond;Inosuke;Human;Male;He did that? That was some move, dammit!
1394;1;18;A Forged Bond;Tanjiro;Human;Male;All right! I should be able to chop off that tough neck now! Water Breathing... The final and most powerful form!
1395;1;18;A Forged Bond;Inosuke;Human;Male;He's got a different air about him now. He's about to do something totally mind-blowing!
1396;1;18;A Forged Bond;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Now I'll finish him off! Total Concentration... Water Breathing... Tenth Form!
1397;1;18;A Forged Bond;Inosuke;Human;Male;L-Look out! Kentaro!
1398;1;18;A Forged Bond;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I-Inosuke! Don't die until I get back! That's one of the Twelve Kizuki! Don't die! Don't die! Whatever you do, don't die!
1399;1;18;A Forged Bond;Inosuke;Human;Male;Oh, crap!
1400;1;18;A Forged Bond;Zenitsu;Human;Male;It's getting really hard to breathe now. I have no feeling in my arms and legs anymore. Nezuko... I'm sorry.
1401;1;18;A Forged Bond;Jigoro;Human;Male;Don't give up! Don't give up! Don't give up!
1402;1;18;A Forged Bond;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Don't... give up! Who are you?
1403;1;18;A Forged Bond;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Yoo-hoo! Are you all right?
1404;1;18;A Forged Bond;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Water Breathing, Second Form! Water Wheel! I managed to land somehow!
1405;1;18;A Forged Bond;Spider Demon Sister;Demon;Female;I beg of you! Please stop!
1406;1;18;A Forged Bond;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;What are you looking at? This isn't some show, you know.
1407;1;18;A Forged Bond;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Wh-What are you doing? Aren't you two allies?
1408;1;18;A Forged Bond;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Allies? Don't put us in the same category as something that flimsy. We're family. We're joined by a powerful bond. And besides, this is between me and my sister. So don't interfere. Or I'll carve you up.
1409;1;18;A Forged Bond;Tanjiro;Human;Male;You're wrong! Whether it's your family or an ally, if you have a strong bond between you, then either one should be just as precious! Calling it flimsy if you're not related by blood... That's not true at all! Not only that, but those who have a strong bond give off the scent of trust! But all I'm picking up from you two is the scent of terror, hatred and repulsion! That's not what you call a bond! It's counterfeit! It's forged!
1410;1;18;A Forged Bond;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;You...
1411;1;18;A Forged Bond;Demon Slayer 4;Human;Male;Hey! Look at that, a demon that's just the right size. Even I can take down a kid demon like this one.
1412;1;18;A Forged Bond;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Hold up a second please!
1413;1;18;A Forged Bond;Demon Slayer 4;Human;Male;You can just back off! I want to take the safe route up the ladder. Since once you move up, you get more money from the top guys. My unit's practically been wiped out, but I'll slay myself a decent-sized demon and head down the mountain. Take this!
1414;1;18;A Forged Bond;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Don't do it! Stop! Shattered to pieces in an instant! But how did he...
1415;1;18;A Forged Bond;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Hey, what did you say? Look, you... What was it that you just said?
1416;1;18;A Forged Bond;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Just look at that intimidation factor! The air just got heavy and denser! Inosuke, I'm sorry! Hang in there, okay? Just a little longer! I'll be there as soon as I defeat this demon! I'll come save you no matter what!
1417;1;18;A Forged Bond;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Hey, you... What you said just now... Let's hear you say it again. Come on. Say it, will you?
1418;1;18;A Forged Bond;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Sure! I'll repeat it as many times as you want! Your bond is forged!
1419;1;18;A Forged Bond;Inosuke;Human;Male;O-Oh, crap! Dammit! Hiding myself in a place like this... How pathetic is that? Still, I gotta come up with a way. How do you slash someone who's sword-proof? What should I do? What should I do? Just how do I slash it? Think! Think! Think! Thinkâ€” Whoa! This is bad! This is really bad! Until... Until he gets back, I gotta somehow... What the hell kind of attitude is that? Don't mess around, dammit! Curse you! Looks like I got infected by Tontaro's germs! Messing around like that... That was way too close a call! Using my head? That's so not me! All right! Slashed you! It's really simple. If you can't slash something with one sword, all you gotta do is pound it with another sword! I mean, look! I have two swords! I'm the almighty! Are you running away on me? Hey you! Come back here, dammit!
1420;1;18;A Forged Bond;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;I just want to let you know... I won't kill you in one blow. After ripping you to shreds, I'll carve you up. But... If you take back what you said just now, I'll do you a favor and kill you at once.
1421;1;18;A Forged Bond;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I won't take it back! What I said was the truth! You know who's not making any sense? It's you! You're the one who's mistaken!
1422;1;18;A Forged Bond;Inosuke;Human;Male;Damn! That bastard... Where the hell did he go, dammit? I'm telling ya, this doesn't hurt! What doesn't hurt doesn't hurt! Now that it's come to this, I'll sniff it out for sure! So, there you are! You idiot piece of crap! How high did you climb up? Damn you! So, you're plotting to make me use my head again, huh? In your dreams! What the... Oh, I get it! He's trembling with fear and dread at the sight of me, huh? Well, it's a little too late for that! What the... Now what? D-Did it just shed its skin? Jeez. Come on, that's bulking up way too much! This is looking really bad for me! I've never sensed this much force from an opponent before! I'll get crushed just by his force! It's no good. I can't win. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna be killed.
1423;1;18;A Forged Bond;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Don't die! Don't die until I get back!
1424;1;18;A Forged Bond;Old Lady Wisteria;Human;Female;Always live your lives with great pride. I wish you luck in battle!
1425;1;18;A Forged Bond;Inosuke;Human;Male;I'm not gonna lose! No way am I gonna lose! I'm Inosuke Hashibira of the Demon Slayer Corps! Just bring it on, you dirtbag! So fast! I can't see it! Beast Breathing... Fang Three, Devour! It snapped! Oh, crap! I failed to go on the defensive with my breath attack!
1426;1;18;A Forged Bond;Spider Demon Father;Demon;Male;Don't come near my family! Stay away!
1427;1;18;A Forged Bond;Inosuke;Human;Male;I'm not gonna die! Beast Breathing Fang One... Take this! Pierce! They're in! They're in, but... what the hell? This thing isn't even flinching!
1428;1;18;A Forged Bond;Inosuke's Mother;Human;Female;I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Inosuke. I want at least you to survive, Inosuke.
1429;1;18;A Forged Bond;Inosuke;Human;Male;Wh-Who are you? Wh-What was that? Did he slash it? That guy? Wh-Who is that? Who on earth... That's fast!
1430;1;18;A Forged Bond;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;Water Breathing, Fourth Form... Striking Tide!
1431;1;18;A Forged Bond;Inosuke;Human;Male;H-Holy crap! I-I've never seen anyone... as incredible as this guy!
1432;1;18;A Forged Bond;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Got it! The acrid odor's starting to fade, so now I can detect the scent of the threads! I can take him on now!
1433;1;18;A Forged Bond;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;He's smarter than I thought. He doesn't flinch back in fear. Well, not that it matters anyway.
1434;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjiro;Human;Male;No way! My sword!
1435;1;19;Hinokami;Inosuke;Human;Male;Amazing! He's on a different level! The force of his stroke is in a different class! He's head and shoulders above the rest! He slashed that tough-as-nails monster like tofu! Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! Who is this guy? I still have goosebumps, dammit! Hold up a second! Fight me, Mismatched Haori! You beat that Twelve Kizuki! And I'm gonna beat you! That's how I've drawn it up! If I can do that... that'll make me the most powerful of all!
1436;1;19;Hinokami;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;Go back to training, idiot.
1437;1;19;Hinokami;Inosuke;Human;Male;What the...
1438;1;19;Hinokami;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;That was no Twelve Kizuki or anything close to one. You can't even tell that much?
1439;1;19;Hinokami;Inosuke;Human;Male;Sure I can tell! I never thought that scrub could be one of the Twelve Kizuki, either! It was Tanjiro who said it was one of the Twelve Kizuki! All I did was repeat what he said, all right? What's going on? Did he just tie me up? So quick! This guy's so quick! Wait, you! Come back here!
1440;1;19;Hinokami;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;Stay out of battle if you don't even realize how hurt you are.
1441;1;19;Hinokami;Inosuke;Human;Male;I can't hear you! Your voice is too soft, and you walk too fast! I said hold up a second! Untie these ropes right now!
1442;1;19;Hinokami;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Hey! Hey! Hey! Yoo-hoo! Are you all right?
1443;1;19;Hinokami;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Gramps...
1444;1;19;Hinokami;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Who are you calling "Gramps"?
1445;1;19;Hinokami;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Just now, Gramps showed up, and told me not to give up.
1446;1;19;Hinokami;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;You saw your life flashing before your eyes. According to one theory, the reason one sees such images just before death is because you're searching for a way to avoid death by going through all your past experiences and memories. Well, not that I can say for sure, since I've never experienced it myself. Right, you did a good job slowing down the poison's path with your breathing. If you hadn't been able to do that, you would've turned into a spider long ago. I'll inject you with the antidote now, okay?
1447;1;19;Hinokami;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;Hurry! Over here, over here!
1448;1;19;Hinokami;Kakushi 2;Human;Female;Can we get them down?
1449;1;19;Hinokami;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;Be careful, okay?
1450;1;19;Hinokami;Kakushi 2;Human;Female;It's all good! Everyone's still alive!
1451;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjiro;Human;Male;My sword got snapped! I can't believe it! The threads this boy is controlling... Does this mean they're even tougher than the body of that demon I couldn't slash? Forgive me, Mr. Urokodaki, Mr. Haganezuka! Thanks to my inexperience, my sword is now broken! No, this isn't the time for that! Think! Think! If I can't slash those threads, then let me get right up in his face! It's no good! Those threads have a life of their own, and I can't get through their attacks! Even though he's holding back enough not to kill me, he's still overwhelming me to this degree!
1452;1;19;Hinokami;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Well? Do you still refuse to take back what you just said? Fine. In that case, you'll get slashed to ribbons.
1453;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I can't dodge them all! Nezuko! Nezuko! Nezuko! You protected me! I'm sorry!
1454;1;19;Hinokami;Spider Demon Sister;Demon;Female;A girl emerged from that box on his shoulders. But she has the aura of a demon!
1455;1;19;Hinokami;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Hey, you... Is that... That girl... Is she your sibling?
1456;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjiro;Human;Male;So what if she is? The wound's so deep! Her left wrist is about to fall off! Hurry up and heal! Hurry up and heal! Hurry up and heal!
1457;1;19;Hinokami;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Siblings... Siblings... The sister's been turned into a demon.
1458;1;19;Hinokami;Spider Demon Sister;Demon;Female;R-Rui?
1459;1;19;Hinokami;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Yet, she stays by his side. The younger sister protected the elder brother. Risking her own life... That's a genuine bond! I want it!
1460;1;19;Hinokami;Spider Demon Sister;Demon;Female;W-Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Please! I'm your elder sister! Don't desert me!
1461;1;19;Hinokami;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Shut up! None of you ever managed to fulfill the roles you were given. Never. Not once.
1462;1;19;Hinokami;Spider Demon Sister;Demon;Female;W-Wait. I was the elder sister you wanted, wasn't I? Give me a chance to redeem myself!
1463;1;19;Hinokami;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;In that case, go kill those people wandering all over this mountain. If you do that, I'll forgive you for what just happened.
1464;1;19;Hinokami;Spider Demon Sister;Demon;Female;F-Fine. I'll go kill them.
1465;1;19;Hinokami;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Boy... Boy, let's talk. Come on out.
1466;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Boy? Talk?
1467;1;19;Hinokami;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;The thing is, I was really moved. Seeing the bond you two share gave me the chills. I doubt there are any words in this universe that can describe how moved I was. But now the only thing left for you is death by my hand. It would be sad if it were to come to pass, right? But there's just one thing. Just one thing that will let you escape that. Your sister... Give your sister to me. If you hand her over without a fight, I'll at least spare your life.
1468;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I have no idea what you're talking about!
1469;1;19;Hinokami;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Your little sister will be my little sister. Starting today.
1470;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjiro;Human;Male;You don't actually think I'd ever agree to that! Not to mention, Nezuko's not a thing! She has her own feelings and will! There's no way she'll ever be your sister!
1471;1;19;Hinokami;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;It's all right. No need to worry. Because I'll create a bond between us. I'm stronger than you. I'm talking about the bond of terror. I'll teach her what will happen if she defies me.
1472;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I've had enough of this crazy talk! Using terror to shackle someone hand and foot is not the bond of a family! Unless you fix that basic misunderstanding, you'll never get what you desire!
1473;1;19;Hinokami;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;So irritating. Would you mind not shouting? We don't see eye to eye, do we?
1474;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'll never hand Nezuko over to you!
1475;1;19;Hinokami;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;That's okay, I guess. I'll just kill you and then take her.
1476;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'll cut off your head first!
1477;1;19;Hinokami;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;That's the spirit! I'd like to see you try it. That is, if you can actually defeat a Twelve Kizuki like me! Family... A father has his role as the father, and the mother has her role as the mother. The parents protect the children, and the elder brother and sister protect their younger siblings. No matter what. At the risk of their own lives. The way I see it, if you don't understand your own role, there's no reason for you to live. What about you? What is your role? Your role is to relinquish your younger sister to me and disappear. If you can't do that, your only option is to die. Because you can't defeat me.
1478;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Lower Five... Just as I thought! That power... This kid is a true Twelve Kizuki! It won't be easy to slash those threads. What should I do? With this broken sword... If that kid's neck turns out to be tougher than the threads...
1479;1;19;Hinokami;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;I don't like that look in your eyes. Glittering like that... What a fool you are. Don't tell me... you think you're going to beat me?
1480;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Nezuko!
1481;1;19;Hinokami;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;All right, I've taken her now. Now, do you recognize what your own role is?
1482;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Let her go!
1483;1;19;Hinokami;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;But I told you I'd spare your life, at least, if you didn't defy me.
1484;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Nezuko's gone! Nezuko!
1485;1;19;Hinokami;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Stop that hollering. I'm sure that's not enough to kill her. After all, she's a demon. But it looks like I'll have to teach her a lesson after all. I'm going to let her bleed for a while. If she still doesn't learn to be docile, I'll just leave her like that until daybreak... and let her roast a bit.
1486;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjiro;Human;Male;You let Nezuko... Let her go!
1487;1;19;Hinokami;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Look, you... I'm sure I'm mistaken, but... You don't think that if you get close enough to me, you can chop off my head, do you? Fine by me. Here. Give it a shot.
1488;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjiro;Human;Male;The blade... won't go through!
1489;1;19;Hinokami;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Didn't I tell you? You have no chance against me. My body is more durable than any thread I manipulate. If you can't even slash those threads, you don't have a chance in hell of slashing my neck.
1490;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjiro;Human;Male;S-So powerful. His power is on a whole different level than any other demon I've fought! So, this is a Twelve Kizuki's... The power of a demon closely related to Kibutsuji?
1491;1;19;Hinokami;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;You're making too much noise. Quiet down a bit.
1492;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Stop that!
1493;1;19;Hinokami;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;I'm your elder brother now. Enough of that infernal wailing.
1494;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Calm down! Don't get emotional! If you keep this up, you'll be playing right into his hands!
1495;1;19;Hinokami;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Did she pass out? Is she asleep? This demon has a unique aura. There's something about her that's not like the rest of us. Interesting.
1496;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Concentrate! Control your breathing! Unleash the most precise, final Form! Total Concentration...
1497;1;19;Hinokami;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;You still don't realize how futile it is?
1498;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Water Breathing! Tenth Form! Constant Flux! I slashed them! I was able to slash the threads!
1499;1;19;Hinokami;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Gathering force with each rotation... This could be trouble.
1500;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I can do it! If I can keep closing the distance between us, I can defeat him!
1501;1;19;Hinokami;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Hey... You don't think these threads are at maximum strength, do you? Blood Demon Art... Cutting Thread Cage. I have no more use for you. Goodbye.
1502;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjiro;Human;Male;No good! I can't slash these threads! I'm still not getting enough spin! These are giving off a totally different scent than the other threads! But I can't afford to lose no matter what! I'm gonna die! I'm gonna lose! I'm... Father...
1503;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjuro Kamado;Human;Male;Tanjiro... Breathe. Get your breathing under control and become Hinokami.
1504;1;19;Hinokami;Kie Kamado;Human;Female;Tanjiro? Look. It's your father's kagura dance. Our family works with fire, so to ward off injuries and disasters, we offer this dance to Hinokami, along with our prayers, on New Year's Day.
1505;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Hey, Mother... How can Father dance like that in the snow for so long when he's so frail? I bet my lungs would freeze.
1506;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjuro Kamado;Human;Male;There's a breathing technique. A way to breathe so that you won't exhaust yourself, no matter how much you move.
1507;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Breathe?
1508;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjuro Kamado;Human;Male;Right. If you can master the correct way to breathe, you'll be able to dance forever, too. The cold won't bother you, either. Tanjiro, if nothing else, make sure this kagura and these earrings get passed down to you uninterrupted. That's what I promised.
1509;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Hinokami Kagura... Dance!
1510;1;19;Hinokami;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;The threads...
1511;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Don't stop! Keep running! If you stop now, it'll bring on the repercussions of forcibly switching from Water Breathing to Hinokami Dance Breathing! When that happens, I'll be immobile for a while! That's why I gotta do it now! Run! You gotta protect Nezuko!
1512;1;19;Hinokami;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;This guy...
1513;1;19;Hinokami;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I see the Opening Thread! You gotta take him down now! Even if it means... getting slashed by him at the same time!
1514;1;19;Hinokami;Kie Kamado;Human;Female;Nezuko... Nezuko... Wake up, Nezuko. You have to save your brother. I know you can do it now, Nezuko. Do your best. Please, Nezuko. Or your brother will be killed, too!
1515;1;19;Hinokami;Nezuko;Demon;Female;Blood Demon Art... Exploding Blood!
1516;1;19;Hinokami;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;No way! The threads burned and snapped!
1517;1;20;Pretend Family;Nezuko;Demon;Female;Blood Demon Art... Exploding Blood!
1518;1;20;Pretend Family;Tanjiro;Human;Male;The bond between Nezuko and me... can't be... severed by anyone! Nezuko! Nezuko! I-I won! I won! My father saved me! I'm not sure why I was able to unleash that attack with the kagura that's been in our family for generations. But that was what saved me! I was able to beat him! Huh? I can't see Nezuko! Is it because I took way too many breaths? This ringing in my ears is brutal! My whole body is throbbing with pain! I gotta... heal up fast! I'm still not done fighting! I gotta go save Inosuke! Right away! The scent of blood just got stronger! Come to think of it, it didn't give off the smell of ash. Don't tell me... Even though I chopped off his head?
1519;1;20;Pretend Family;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;You thought you'd defeated me? Poor kid. Did your pathetic delusion bring you joy? I cut off my head myself with my own threads... before you could chop it off. Enough. I'll kill both you and your sister. I haven't been this enraged in a long time.
1520;1;20;Pretend Family;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Get up! Get up right now! Get your breathing under control! Hurry! Right now!
1521;1;20;Pretend Family;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;But I wonder why you're not burning up. It was only me and my threads that caught fire, right? I don't know if it's your sister's power, but thanks for getting me super-annoyed. Now I can carve you up with no regrets.
1522;1;20;Pretend Family;Tanjiro;Human;Male;If you use the correct breathing technique, it makes no difference how exhausted you are!
1523;1;20;Pretend Family;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Blood Demon Art... Murderous Eye Basket!
1524;1;20;Pretend Family;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Don't panic! Don't let it disrupt your breathing! Calm down... if you can calm down! I can't raise... my arm! Somebody's here. Is it Zenitsu?
1525;1;20;Pretend Family;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;You did a good job holding out until I got here. Leave the rest to me.
1526;1;20;Pretend Family;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;You're like an endless stream... of lowlifes always getting in my way! Blood Demon Art... Cutting Thread Rotation!
1527;1;20;Pretend Family;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;Total Concentration... Water Breathing... Eleventh Form... Dead Calm.
1528;1;20;Pretend Family;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Eleventh Form?
1529;1;20;Pretend Family;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Who cares about your Eleventh Form? What? What's going on? What did he do? The instant I got up in his face, the threads scattered. Not one of them reached him? The toughest threads of all got slashed? That's impossible! One more time!
1530;1;20;Pretend Family;Spider Demon Sister;Demon;Female;I messed up! I messed up! And I was the only one who never messed up until now in this "Pretend Family" game!
1531;1;20;Pretend Family;Demon Slayer 5;Human;Male;We finally drove her into a corner!
1532;1;20;Pretend Family;Demon Slayer 6;Human;Male;Hey, look at that. A demon?
1533;1;20;Pretend Family;Demon Slayer 5;Human;Male;It's just a kid. But even if it looks like a kid, it's still a demon! If we let it go, it'll devour humans!
1534;1;20;Pretend Family;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Hey... Hey... You want me save you? In return, will you do what I ask?
1535;1;20;Pretend Family;Spider Demon Sister;Demon;Female;I'll do anything! I'll do whatever you want, so please save me!
1536;1;20;Pretend Family;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Then, become a part of my family.
1537;1;20;Pretend Family;Spider Demon Sister;Demon;Female;I will! I'll do it!
1538;1;20;Pretend Family;Demon Slayer 5;Human;Male;What are they talking about? All right, it's over for you!
1539;1;20;Pretend Family;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Welcome. Starting today, you're part of my family, too.
1540;1;20;Pretend Family;Spider Demon Sister 2;Demon;Female;Drink this. Our family's power belongs to Rui. Since we were all weak demons, Rui shared his power with us. Because Rui is one of that person's favorites, he gets special permission to do this kind of thing.
1541;1;20;Pretend Family;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Do you feel it? You don't have to fear those demon hunters anymore. Now then, time for the finishing touches. All right, you can look up now. Congratulations. You're truly part of the family now.
1542;1;20;Pretend Family;Spider Demon Sister 2;Demon;Female;We're only playing house.
1543;1;20;Pretend Family;Spider Demon Sister;Demon;Female;What?
1544;1;20;Pretend Family;Spider Demon Sister 2;Demon;Female;We have no blood ties. We're just a clan of assorted strangers.
1545;1;20;Pretend Family;Spider Demon Mother;Demon;Female;I'm so sorry! I'll do better, Rui! I'll practice! Forgive me! I'm so sorry I couldn't do it well! It's just that I revert by accident sometimes!
1546;1;20;Pretend Family;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;I don't want to hear your excuses, Mother. Play the role of mother like you should.
1547;1;20;Pretend Family;Spider Demon Mother;Demon;Female;I know what I must do, Rui.
1548;1;20;Pretend Family;Spider Demon Sister 2;Demon;Female;We were all so scared of the demon hunters and just wanted companions. It's not like we wanted to take part in this baffling "Pretend Family" game. But those who fail to go along with Rui's demands and orders get carved up or have their intellect taken from them or get strung up, exposed to the sunlight. I've had enough of this.
1549;1;20;Pretend Family;Spider Demon Sister;Demon;Female;I'm going to pretend I never heard you say thatâ€”
1550;1;20;Pretend Family;Spider Demon Sister 2;Demon;Female;I know you're not a fool. Unlike all the others. Let's run away together. I wouldn't say this to anyone but you. You're the one person I truly think of as my younger sister. Tomorrow, Rui is going to be summoned by that person and descend the mountain. That's our chance to escape.
1551;1;20;Pretend Family;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;How disappointing.
1552;1;20;Pretend Family;Spider Demon Sister;Demon;Female;They were all fools, but I'm not like them! Even so, I messed up! Rui! Rui! Mother's been killed! And our elder brother, too! What should we do? The demon hunters aren't far behind. Listen... Sh-Shouldn't we make a run for it? Don't...
1553;1;20;Pretend Family;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;You know, don't you? I really hate it when your face reverts. What are you looking at? This isn't some show, you know.
1554;1;20;Pretend Family;Spider Demon Sister;Demon;Female;I only got my face slashed, so I got off easy!
1555;1;20;Pretend Family;Murata;Human;Male;A demon! What the...
1556;1;20;Pretend Family;Spider Demon Sister;Demon;Female;It's futile. You'll never cut through them. You see, my Ball of Yarn may feel soft, but it's extremely hard.
1557;1;20;Pretend Family;Murata;Human;Male;Whaaa...
1558;1;20;Pretend Family;Spider Demon Sister;Demon;Female;First, the solvent will melt those clothes out of the way. And then, it'll be your turn. You'll be reduced to mush in no time, and then I'll feed on you.
1559;1;20;Pretend Family;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;How amazing! Do you release those threads from the palms of your hands? Good evening. The moon is quite lovely tonight, don't you think? I can see you have no intention of being my friend.
1560;1;20;Pretend Family;Spider Demon Sister;Demon;Female;W-W-Wait! I beg of you! I'm being forced to do this! If I defy him, I'll be slashed to shreds!
1561;1;20;Pretend Family;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Is that right? That does sound tragic! I'll spare you! Let's be friends!
1562;1;20;Pretend Family;Spider Demon Sister;Demon;Female;Y-You're going to spare me?
1563;1;20;Pretend Family;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Yes! But in order for us to be friends, I must ask you a few questions. Sweet young girl, how many people have you killed?
1564;1;20;Pretend Family;Spider Demon Sister;Demon;Female;Five. But I was ordered to! I had no choice!
1565;1;20;Pretend Family;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;There's no need to lie about it. Because I already know. That spell you cast to turn one of our men into a cocoon was most impressive!
1566;1;20;Pretend Family;Murata;Human;Male;Help me! Somebody!
1567;1;20;Pretend Family;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;You've devoured at least eighty humans, haven't you?
1568;1;20;Pretend Family;Spider Demon Sister;Demon;Female;No, of course I haven't eaten that many. I only killed those five.
1569;1;20;Pretend Family;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;But I came here from the west, you know. The west, my dear. On the west side of the mountain, I saw hordes of cocoons hanging from the trees. The human captives inside had been liquefied. All massacred. In that spot alone, I counted at least fourteen cocoons. Fourteen humans. All dead. Oh, it's not that I'm angry. I'm only trying to confirm the accurate toll.
1570;1;20;Pretend Family;Spider Demon Sister;Demon;Female;What good will it do you to confirm that?
1571;1;20;Pretend Family;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;You'll receive the penalty you deserve and be reborn!
1572;1;20;Pretend Family;Spider Demon Sister;Demon;Female;Penalty?
1573;1;20;Pretend Family;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;That way, you and I can become friends. If you go unpunished after having taken all those lives, your victims will never get justice. I could gouge out your eyeballs or slash your stomach to rip out your organs. For every person you've killed, I shall torture you. And after you've suffered through all of the pain and agony, your sins will be forgiven. Let's both give it our all! Don't worry! Since you're a demon, my dear, surely it won't kill you and neither will there be any after effects!
1574;1;20;Pretend Family;Spider Demon Sister;Demon;Female;Who do you think you're kidding? Die! You damn witch!
1575;1;20;Pretend Family;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;I can see that we'll never be friends. Oh, what a pity! Insect Breathing Butterfly Dance... Caprice.
1576;1;20;Pretend Family;Spider Demon Sister;Demon;Female;My head... hasn't been cut off! That's the sword she's using? I see. She's too tiny and has no arm strength, so beheading is beyond her. That's someone I can defeat!
1577;1;20;Pretend Family;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;You mustn't think you're safe just because you haven't been beheaded. Because there are swordswomen like me who use poison. Demon Slayer Corps, Insect Hashira, Shinobu Kocho. I may be the only swordswoman among the Hashiras unable to decapitate demons, but as I've created a poison lethal to demons, I'm also rather awesome. Oh! Pardon me! You're dead, so you can't hear me, can you? Careless of me! Are you all right?
1578;1;20;Pretend Family;Murata;Human;Male;Just barely! What happened to the demon? Shouldn't you finish it off?
1579;1;20;Pretend Family;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;I killed her with wisteria poison. She's already dead, so if we leave her, she'll rot. I'm a pharmaceuticals expert! Your clothes did get dissolved, but your body is more or less unscathed! I'm so glad! Now then, as for the whereabouts of the demon that forced this girl to do his bidding... Did Tomioka beat me to it, then?
1580;1;20;Pretend Family;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Nezuko... Nezuko!
1581;1;20;Pretend Family;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;I'll kill them! I'll kill them! I'll kill those siblings no matter what! Siblings!
1582;1;20;Pretend Family;Spider Demon Mother;Demon;Female;What is it that you want to do, Rui? What do you mean by "family"?
1583;1;20;Pretend Family;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;I don't know. Because I have no memories of when I was human.
1584;1;20;Pretend Family;Spider Demon Mother;Demon;Female;Is that why you made us pretend to be your family?
1585;1;20;Pretend Family;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;I thought that if I could feel a family bond, my memories would come back. The bond of a real family... That's right. I...
1586;1;20;Pretend Family;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Nezuko!
1587;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Rui's Mother;Human;Female;Rui! Rui! Rui! What are you doing? You know you're not supposed to be outside!
1588;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;I was always very frail ever since I was born. I'd never even run. Just walking was a struggle. Until Master Muzan appeared.
1589;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Muzan;Demon;N/a;You pitiful thing. Let me save you.
1590;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;My parents weren't happy about it. Because now that I'd acquired a strong body, I could never expose myself to sunlight, and I had to devour humans.
1591;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Rui's Father;Human;Male;What have you done? What on earth have you done? Rui!
1592;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Long ago, I heard a wonderful story. There was once a father who died trying to save his drowning child. I was deeply moved. Such astounding parental love. And such a bond, as well. This father who drowned in the river had fulfilled his role as a parent. And yet, for some reason, my own parents... My own parents tried to... kill me. All my mother did was sob, never lifting a finger to protect me as I was about to be killed. They must've been imposters. The bond between us wasn't real.
1593;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Rui's Mother;Human;Female;Sorry...
1594;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;She's saying something. So, she's still alive?
1595;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Rui's Mother;Human;Female;...for not giving you a strong, healthy body. I'm so sorry.
1596;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Those were my mother's last words before she died. She died.
1597;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Rui's Father;Human;Male;It's all right, Rui! We're going to die with you!
1598;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;I was so enraged that he'd tried to kill me that my father's words went over my head. But in that moment, I realized that he meant to die with me to atone for my sin of having murdered another. It was a genuine bond. And that night, I severed it with my own two hands. Even so, Master Muzan gave me words of encouragement.
1599;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Muzan;Demon;N/a;It was all your parents' fault for refusing to accept you. Take pride in your own strength.
1600;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;I had no other choice but to look at it that way. I couldn't bear the weight of what I'd done. Even knowing that I only had myself to blame... Every single day... I missed my parents so much that I could barely stand it. Even after creating a fake family, the feeling of emptiness wouldn't go away. Since I was the one with the most power, there was no one who could protect me... who could shield me. The more powerful I became, the less I remembered about being a human. And I was losing sight of what it was that I wanted to do. Seeking a bond that I could never claim for myself. Even though it was simply out of my reach no matter how I strained to get my hands on it.
1601;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Tanjiro;Human;Male;That small body... is giving off the scent of a grief too overwhelming for him to bear.
1602;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;So warm. Hands as gentle as sunlight. Now I remember as clear as day. What I wanted was to apologize. I'm sorry. I was... I was to blame for it all. I hope you can forgive me. But since I've killed scores of people, I'm going to Hell, aren't I? Father... Mother... I can't go to the same place as you, can I?
1603;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Rui's Father;Human;Male;That's not true. We'll be going together even if it's to Hell. Rui...
1604;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;Father... Mother...
1605;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Rui's Mother;Human;Female;Rui... No matter where you go, we'll be with you.
1606;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Rui (Lower Moon 5);Demon;Male;It was all... It was all my fault! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
1607;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;Don't waste any sympathy on a demon that devoured humans. It doesn't matter if it looks like a child. It's still a hideous monster that's lived for decades.
1608;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Tanjiro;Human;Male;To avenge the people who were killed, to make sure there are no more victims, of course, I'll bring my blade down on any demon's neck without mercy! But as for those for whom being a demon meant despair, those who regretted their own actions... I will never trample over them! Because demons were once human, too! Just like me, they were human, too! Please step off him! They're not hideous monsters at all! Demons are hopeless creatures! They're tragic creatures!
1609;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;You're...
1610;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Oh my... Why would you get in my way, Tomioka? After telling me that we could never be friends with demons... How should I put this? That's exactly why... no one likes you, you know.
1611;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;Man, this antidote of Lady Kocho's is effective!
1612;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Kakushi 2;Human;Female;That's right. And she prepared it after one look at this situation. She's truly amazing. That goes for him, too.
1613;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;Oh, that guy?
1614;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Kakushi 2;Human;Female;Because he defeated that demon, it slowed the circulation of the poison just a bit.
1615;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;All right! This should do it! Looking good! Chances are, they'll all pull through.
1616;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Kakushi 2;Human;Female;Still, I'd like to wrap things up quickly and leave this place as soon as possible, wouldn't you?
1617;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;Yeah, me, too. I mean, this place really, really stinks!
1618;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;All right, Tomioka, please move out of the way.
1619;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;I'm not... I'm not disliked by people.
1620;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Well, I'm sorry. You haven't even realized that people don't like you, then? That was uncalled for. Please forgive me. Little boy!
1621;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yes!
1622;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;What you're protecting there is a demon. I don't want you to get hurt, so please move away.
1623;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Y-You're mistaken! I mean, you're not mistaken, but... she's my kid sister! She's my kid sister, so... You see...
1624;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Is that right? Poor thing. In that case, I shall use a gentle toxin to kill her, so she won't suffer, all right?
1625;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;Can you move? Make yourself move even if you can't move. Take your sister and run.
1626;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Tomioka... Sorry for the trouble! Thank you very much!
1627;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Isn't that against the Corps rules?
1628;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Tanjiro;Human;Male;My whole body is aching! It's so painful! I want to scream from the pain! Deal with it! Deal with it! Deal with it! Deal with it! Deal with it! Deal with it! Deal with it! Does this mean I'll have to quit the Demon Slayer Corps? Even if she's my sister, there's no way they'd let one of their swordsmen travel with a demon!
1629;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;I see you're dead serious, Tomioka. Who would've thought a Hashira would ever defend a demon? Whether you're dead serious or not, I'm not going to join you in stalling for time. So, good day to you. Is that your attempt at catching up with me? I don't mind you trying to stop me, but don't forget about the other one!
1630;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Don't stop running! Keep moving! You gotta run as far away as you can! Not good! What happened? It was all I could do to just keep running! Nezuko! A Demon Slayer! Run, Nezuko! Run! Make a run for it! Don't get caught no matter what! Hurryâ€”
1631;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Kanao Tsuyuri;Human;Female;She shrunk and turned into a child. All she's doing is running away. Not a single attack. But why? No need to ponder. My only job is to slay this demon as I was told.
1632;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Tomioka? Are you listening, Tomioka? Since the purpose of my attack was to slay a demon, and therefore justified, I don't believe it could be construed as a violation. But what you're doing is against the Corps rules. You're preventing me from slaying a demon. Just what are your intentions here? Don't you have anything to say? This is your final warning. Give me a reason at least.
1633;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;If I'm remembering this right, it was two years ago.
1634;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Please don't start some long, rambling story from that far back in time. Are you just being spiteful? Are you perhaps still angry that I pointed out how people don't like you?
1635;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Crow;Bird;Bird;Message! Message! I have a message from headquarters! Tanjiro and Nezuko are to be taken into custody and brought back to headquarters! Tanjiro and the demon, Nezuko, are to be taken into custody and brought back to headquarters! Tanjiro, dressed in a checkered haori, with a scar on his forehead! Nezuko, a demon girl with a bamboo muzzle! Bring them back! Bring them back!
1636;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Kanao Tsuyuri;Human;Female;Are you Nezuko?
1637;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Crow;Bird;Bird;Bring them back! Bring them back! Tanjiro, dressed in a checkered haori, with a scar on his forehead! Nezuko, a demon girl with a bamboo muzzle! Bring them back! Bring them back!
1638;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Kakushi 2;Human;Female;He has a scar on his forehead.
1639;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;All right, take him into custody.
1640;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Kakushi 2;Human;Female;Look. His jawbone seems to be broken, doesn't it?
1641;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;I feel bad about tying him up.
1642;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Kakushi 3;Human;Male;Wh-Who the hell is this?
1643;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Kakushi 4;Human;Male;I don't know.
1644;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Kakushi 3;Human;Male;A demon? Couldn't be, right? Is it a human?
1645;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Kakushi 4;Human;Male;He's wearing our uniform trousers.
1646;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Kakushi 3;Human;Male;Oh hey, this is a mask! He's a human!
1647;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Kakushi 4;Human;Male;All right, let's bring him in.
1648;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Kakushi 3;Human;Male;This guy's really banged up!
1649;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Kakushi 4;Human;Male;Why's he strung up like this?
1650;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Inosuke;Human;Male;There was nothing I could do... On my own, I couldn't bring down even a single demon! You know what? Maybe I'm not that strong.
1651;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Zenitsu;Human;Male;They wrapped us up like mummies. Who are these people? They seem to be cleaning up this place really efficiently. And that girl there... Isn't she the girl from Final Selection? She has the same kind of hair ornament as the lady who wrapped us up.
1652;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Kakushi 5;Human;Male;Should we bring them to the Butterfly Mansion, as well?
1653;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Kanao Tsuyuri;Human;Female;Yes, bring all of the wounded to our place. I'll be hunting down the demons in the area so you can work without any worries.
1654;1;21;Against Corps Rules;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Come to think of it, I've heard about them. The cleanup crew, the Kakushis. The unit that cleans up after the Demon Slayer Corps battles demons. They say that most of its members are people who have no swordsmanship skills. It's daybreak.
1655;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;Wake up. Hey, I said wake up! Wake... Hey! Hey you! C'mon, you! C'mon! Are you gonna sleep all day? Wake the hell up, will you?
1656;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Tengen Uzui;Human;Male;Bummer. I heard he was a Demon Slayer with a demon in tow, so I was looking forward to seeing someone flamboyant, but that's one drab-looking dude, huh?
1657;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Kyojuro Rengoku;Human;Male;And now, we'll put this boy on trial! I see!
1658;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Mitsuri Kanroji;Human;Female;To think that he's been protecting his sister who's now a demon... Now that's beautiful sibling love! How brave!
1659;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Wh-Who are these peopâ€”
1660;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;Don't open your mouth just yet, you moron! Just who do you think is standing before you? You're in the presence of the Hashiras!
1661;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Hashiras? What is a Hashira? What's he talking about? And who are these people exactly? Where am I now?
1662;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;This is the Demon Slayers' headquarters. And you're about to be put on trial... Tanjiro Kamado. Before we start the trial, why don't you explain the crime you've commâ€”
1663;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Kyojuro Rengoku;Human;Male;There's no need for a trial! Protecting a demon is a clear violation of the code! We're within our rights to deal with him on our own! We're going to behead him along with the demon!
1664;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Tengen Uzui;Human;Male;In that case, I'll be glad to decapitate him flamboyantly. I'll show you the most flamboyant bloodspray you'll ever see. I'm talking max flamboyance.
1665;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Mitsuri Kanroji;Human;Female;What? You'd kill such an adorable child? That pains my heart! It fills me with anguish!
1666;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Gyomei Himejima;Human;Male;Ah, what a pitiful sight this boy is. The poor soul... I pity him for having been born at all.
1667;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Muichiro Tokito;Human;Male;Um, what was the shape of that cloud again? What was it called again?
1668;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Where's Nezuko? Nezuko!
1669;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;Hey you... The Hashiras are speaking. What are you looking at? These are the nine highest-ranking swordsmen in the Demon Slayer Corps.
1670;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Hashiras...
1671;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Gyomei Himejima;Human;Male;Let's put him out of his misery.
1672;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Tengen Uzui;Human;Male;Yeah! Let's do it. Flamboyantly.
1673;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;Hey!
1674;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Nezuko... Nezuko, where are you? Nezuko! Zenitsu! Inosuke! Murata!
1675;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Obanai Iguro;Human;Male;Forget that. What will we do with Tomioka? Seeing him there without any restraints is giving me a headache. Based on what Kocho told us, Tomioka's just as guilty of breaking the Corps rules. How will we deal with him? How should we make him take responsibility? What kind of lesson should we teach him? Don't you have anything to say, Tomioka?
1676;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Because of me, now even Tomioka...
1677;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Mitsuri Kanroji;Human;Female;Iguro, you're as serpent-like as ever! Such a nag! I love how pesky you are! Tomioka! All by himself at a distance! How cute!
1678;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Oh, where's the harm? He did come along without resisting. Let's come up with a penalty later. What I'm more interested in is hearing this boy's story. The reason he's going on missions with a demon in tow despite being a Demon Slayer... I'd like to hear the explanation from the boy himself. Needless to say, what he's done is against the Demon Slayer Corps rules. You are aware of that, aren't you? Tanjiro Kamado... Why are you traveling with a demon when you're a Demon Slayer?
1679;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Tengen Uzui;Human;Male;No need to ask.
1680;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;You can take your time. Just tell us why.
1681;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;She's my... She's my youngerâ€”
1682;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;I do believe you need some water. You've injured your jaw, so please drink slowly. It contains a painkiller, so it will make you feel better. It's not as if your wounds are healed, so you mustn't push yourself. Now then, Tanjiro Kamado...
1683;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;That demon is my younger sister! While I was away, my family was attacked by a demon, and when I got home, they were all dead! My sister got turned into a demon, but she's never devoured anyone! She never has... and never will! She'll never hurt humans no matter what!
1684;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Obanai Iguro;Human;Male;Spare us your absurd ravings. If she's family, no wonder you're defending her. I can't trust a single word you're saying. I, for one, don't believe you.
1685;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Gyomei Himejima;Human;Male;She's been possessed by a demon. Let us kill this poor child immediately so that she can be liberated!
1686;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Listen to me please! I became a swordsman so that Nezuko could be cured! It's been two years since Nezuko became a demon! And in all that time, she hasn't devoured one human!
1687;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Tengen Uzui;Human;Male;Your story's spinning in the most drab way possible, idiot. The fact that she hasn't eaten anyone, that she won't from now on. Don't just give us lip service. Prove it to us with max flamboyance.
1688;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Muichiro Tokito;Human;Male;What was that bird again?
1689;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Mitsuri Kanroji;Human;Female;Um... Excuse me? I do have my doubts, you know. I just can't imagine the Master being in the dark about this situation. Do you really think it's okay to deal with him without his permission? Shouldn't we at least wait until he arrives?
1690;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;My sister... My sister will fight with me by my side! She can fight as a Demon Slayer to protect humans! So please...
1691;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Sanemi Shinazugawa;Human;Male;Well, well, I see you have some fun brewing here. Is that the moron Slayer who has a demon with him? What the hell are you trying to pull here?
1692;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Mitsuri Kanroji;Human;Female;Shinazugawa! You've gained even more scars! How gorgeous you look!
1693;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Kakushi 2;Human;Female;This won't do, Master Shinazugawa! Please, would you mind putting down that box?
1694;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Mitsuri Kanroji;Human;Female;Shinobu looks pretty angry! Now, that's unusual! She's so cool!
1695;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Shinazugawa, please don't act out of line.
1696;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Sanemi Shinazugawa;Human;Male;What did you say about that demon, kid? That she can fight as a Demon Slayer to protect humans? You know what we call that? A total delusion, you moron!
1697;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Anyone who hurts my sister... Hashira or not, I won't let you get away with it!
1698;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Sanemi Shinazugawa;Human;Male;Is that right? Good for you!
1699;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;Stop it! The Master will be arriving soon!
1700;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Mitsuri Kanroji;Human;Female;Pardon me.
1701;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Sanemi Shinazugawa;Human;Male;Damn you!
1702;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Obanai Iguro;Human;Male;Even though Tomioka ran interference, he still landed a blow on Shinazugawa.
1703;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;If you can't tell the difference between good demons and bad, you should just quit being a Hashira!
1704;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Sanemi Shinazugawa;Human;Male;You little... I'll destroy you!
1705;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Gemelas;Human;Female;- The Master... - The Master... - ...has arrived. - ...has arrived.
1706;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Master Ubuyashiki;Human;Male;So good of you to come. My beloved children...
1707;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Gemelas;Human;Female;- The Master... - The Master... - ...has arrived. - ...has arrived.
1708;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Master Ubuyashiki;Human;Male;Good morning, everyone. The weather is amazingly good today. I wonder if the sky is blue. It pleases me that we've made it to our semiannual Hashira Meeting with no personnel changes.
1709;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Wounded. No, is he sick? So, that man's the Master? So quick! I couldn't even react! This...
1710;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Sanemi Shinazugawa;Human;Male;I am pleased to see you in good health, as well, Master. I fervently pray for your continued good fortune.
1711;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Master Ubuyashiki;Human;Male;Thank you, Sanemi.
1712;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Mitsuri Kanroji;Human;Female;I wanted to say that! Offer my greetings to the Master!
1713;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Sanemi Shinazugawa;Human;Male;If I may, Master... Before we start the Hashira Meeting, would you mind enlightening us about this swordsman, Tanjiro Kamado, accompanied by a demon?
1714;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;He didn't seem to have a drop of intellect or logic, but he's speaking so formally now!
1715;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Master Ubuyashiki;Human;Male;Right. I apologize for startling you all. About Tanjiro and Nezuko... I've sanctioned their situation. And I'd also like you all to accept it.
1716;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Gyomei Himejima;Human;Male;Even if it's what you desire, Master, I cannot agree to it.
1717;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Tengen Uzui;Human;Male;I'm flamboyantly opposed, as well! A Demon Slayer traveling with a demon is unacceptable!
1718;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Mitsuri Kanroji;Human;Female;I shall do whatever it is you wish, Master!
1719;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Muichiro Tokito;Human;Male;I'm fine either way... since I'm going to forget anyway.
1720;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Obanai Iguro;Human;Male;I won't trust them. I won't trust them. In the first place, I loathe demons.
1721;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Kyojuro Rengoku;Human;Male;Although I respect you with all my heart, that's an incomprehensible notion, Master! I oppose it with everything I've got!
1722;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Sanemi Shinazugawa;Human;Male;The Demon Slayer Corps' mission is to annihilate demons. I request that you penalize both Kamado and Tomioka!
1723;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Master Ubuyashiki;Human;Male;The letter.
1724;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Gemelas;Human;Female;Yes, Master. This is a letter received from a former Hashira, Sakonji Urokodaki. I shall read you an abridged version. Please allow Tanjiro to be accompanied by his sister, a demon.
1725;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Urokodaki;Human;Male;Because of her resilient mental strength, Nezuko has not lost her human emotions. Even in a starved state, she never devoured humans, and this has held true more than two years later. Although the situation seems somewhat far-fetched, it is an indisputable fact. In the event that Nezuko does assault a human, Tanjiro Kamado, as well as... ...Sakonji Urokodaki and Giyu Tomioka will atone by committed seppuku."
1726;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Sanemi Shinazugawa;Human;Male;So, what if they commit seppuku? If you want to die, then rot to death for all I care! It's no guarantee! Not by a long shot!
1727;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Kyojuro Rengoku;Human;Male;Shinazugawa is right! If she kills and devours human, there's no coming back from that! It won't bring back the people who were killed!
1728;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Master Ubuyashiki;Human;Male;You do have a point.
1729;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Sanemi Shinazugawa;Human;Male;In that case...
1730;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Kyojuro Rengoku;Human;Male;Master!
1731;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Master Ubuyashiki;Human;Male;We can't guarantee that she won't attack humans. We can't prove it. That said... We also can't prove that she will attack humans. The fact is that Nezuko has refrained from devouring humans for more than two years, and also that there are three people risking their lives for her. To reject this notion, those who reject it must offer an even more convincing argument. Do you all have the will to do so? Also, there's something I'd like to relay to you, my children. Tanjiro here has met Kibutsuji.
1732;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Tengen Uzui;Human;Male;No, impossible! Even when no Hashira has ever crossed paths with him? You mean this kid... What did he look like? What about his powers? Where did this take place?
1733;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Muichiro Tokito;Human;Male;Did you battle him?
1734;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Sanemi Shinazugawa;Human;Male;What was Kibutsuji doing? Did you find his stronghold? Hey, answer me!
1735;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Tengen Uzui;Human;Male;Shut up! I asked him first! First, tell us what powers Kibutsuji has!
1736;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Master Ubuyashiki;Human;Male;Kibutsuji has sent pursuers after Tanjiro. Though his purpose may simply be to silence him, now that Kibutsuji's given himself away for the first time, I don't want to let go. I also believe something's happening to Nezuko that Kibutsuji never saw coming. Can you try to understand?
1737;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Sanemi Shinazugawa;Human;Male;No, I can't understand, Master. If it were human, I'd be okay with letting it live, but not a demon! Not after all that we the Demon Slayers have gone through in battle! Not after so many people have lost their lives! It's unacceptable!
1738;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Mitsuri Kanroji;Human;Female;What are you doing? What are you doing? You're soiling the garden!
1739;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Sanemi Shinazugawa;Human;Male;Master! I will prove it to you myself! The sheer ugliness of a demon!
1740;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Master Ubuyashiki;Human;Male;Sanemi...
1741;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Sanemi Shinazugawa;Human;Male;Hey, demon! It's time to eat! Sink your teeth in this! No need to force yourself to hold back. Just show us your true colors, and I'll obliterate you right here!
1742;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Nezuko!
1743;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Obanai Iguro;Human;Male;Shinazugawa, it's no good doing it in the sunlight. We have to go into the shadows, or the demon won't show its face.
1744;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Sanemi Shinazugawa;Human;Male;Master, please forgive this discourtesy.
1745;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Stop it!
1746;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Sanemi Shinazugawa;Human;Male;Come on out, demon! Look, it's the human blood you love so much!
1747;1;22;Master of the Mansion;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I can't breathe! I can't move! Nezuko!
1748;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Sanemi Shinazugawa;Human;Male;Come on out, demon!
1749;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Stop it!
1750;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Sanemi Shinazugawa;Human;Male;Look, it's the human blood you love so much! What's the matter, demon? Come on! You know you want it.
1751;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Iguro, you're digging into him too hard. Ease up a bit please.
1752;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Obanai Iguro;Human;Male;I'm only holding him down because he's trying to move.
1753;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Kamado, if you use any breathing techniques while your lungs are being squeezed, your veins will burst.
1754;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Tengen Uzui;Human;Male;His veins will burst! I like it! Sounds flamboyant! Come on! Start bursting!
1755;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Gyomei Himejima;Human;Male;Poor soul... Such a weak, pathetic child. Namu Amida Butsu.
1756;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Kamado?
1757;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Nezuko! She's my sister! She's my younger sister! Nezuko is different! Though I don't know how it happened!
1758;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Urokodaki;Human;Male;All humans are your family. Protect humans.
1759;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Nezuko;Demon;Female;Humans are to be protected and saved. Never hurt them. I will never hurt them.
1760;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Master Ubuyashiki;Human;Male;What just happened?
1761;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Gemelas;Human;Female;The demon girl turned her back in disgust. Although she'd been stabbed three times by Shinazugawa, and despite his flaunting of his bloody arm in her face, she restrained herself and did not bite.
1762;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Master Ubuyashiki;Human;Male;So now, it's been proven that Nezuko won't attack humans, right?
1763;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Obanai Iguro;Human;Male;What do you think you're doing, Tomioka?
1764;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Master Ubuyashiki;Human;Male;Tanjiro... I'm sure that even after this, there are some who can't accept Nezuko. You must prove it to them starting now. That you and Nezuko can fight as Demon Slayers. That you can be useful.
1765;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Tanjiro;Human;Male;What is this feeling? It's like I'm floating. His voice... Is it because of this man's voice that I'm feeling light in the head?
1766;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Master Ubuyashiki;Human;Male;Go out and defeat a Twelve Kizuki. Do that, and you'll be accepted by all. And it will give more weight to your words.
1767;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I... Nezuko and I will defeat Muzan Kibutsuji! Nezuko and I will do it for sure! Strike with the sword that will stop the chain of grief!
1768;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Master Ubuyashiki;Human;Male;As you're ill-equipped to do so right now, Tanjiro, let's start by defeating a Twelve Kizuki, all right?
1769;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yes, sir.
1770;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Mitsuri Kanroji;Human;Female;You mustn't laugh! You mustn't, you mustn't, you mustn't!
1771;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Master Ubuyashiki;Human;Male;It goes without saying that the Hashiras of the Demon Slayer Corps have phenomenal skills. After training themselves to death, they have defied death, and they've also defeated Twelve Kizukis.
1772;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kyojuro Rengoku;Human;Male;A good attitude to have!
1773;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Master Ubuyashiki;Human;Male;That is why Hashiras receive respect and preferential treatment. So, Tanjiro, mind your manners when you speak.
1774;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Y-Yes, sir!
1775;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Master Ubuyashiki;Human;Male;One more thing. Sanemi... Obanai... Don't torment the younger ones too much.
1776;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Obanai Iguro;Human;Male;As you wish.
1777;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Sanemi Shinazugawa;Human;Male;As you wish.
1778;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Master Ubuyashiki;Human;Male;Tanjiro, we have concluded our business with you. You may step back.
1779;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;In that case, allow me to take Kamado into my house. All right, then! Take them away please!
1780;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;Pardon me for cutting in front of you!
1781;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Master Ubuyashiki;Human;Male;Now then, let us begin the Hashira Meetâ€”
1782;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Hold on a second!
1783;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;Come back here!
1784;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Please allow me to head-butt that man covered in scars! I gottaâ€”
1785;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;Shut up! Keep your mouth shut!
1786;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I gotta head-butt him as many times as he stabbed Nezuko! Head-butting isn't a violation of the Corps rules, right?
1787;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 2;Human;Female;Shut up! Settle down now!
1788;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Tanjiro;Human;Male;- Let go of me!
1789;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 2;Human;Female;- Cut it out!
1790;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Muichiro Tokito;Human;Male;You're not allowed to interrupt the Master.
1791;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;- We beg your pardon!
1792;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 2;Human;Female;- We beg your pardon, Master!
1793;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;- Master Tokito!
1794;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 2;Human;Female;- We beg your pardon!
1795;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;We beg your pardon! We assure you that this boy will be severely reprimanded, soâ€”
1796;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Mitsuri Kanroji;Human;Female;Muichiro! What a fine boy!
1797;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;So please! Please!
1798;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Mitsuri Kanroji;Human;Female;So cool!
1799;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Muichiro Tokito;Human;Male;Just get out of our sight.
1800;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;- Yes, sir!
1801;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 2;Human;Female;- Yes, sir!
1802;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Master Ubuyashiki;Human;Male;Tanjiro... Give Miss Tamayo my regards.
1803;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Hold up a second! I just heard him mention Miss Tamayo's name!
1804;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 2;Human;Female;Don't you say another word! - We got yelled at because of you!
1805;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;- I thought I'd pee my pants!
1806;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 2;Human;Female;You don't know how terrifying the Hashiras are!
1807;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;Try to read the room! Read it!
1808;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 2;Human;Female;- I'll never forgive you as long as I live!
1809;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;- I'll never forgive you! - Apologize!
1810;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 2;Human;Female;- Apologize! Apologize!
1811;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I... I'm sorry.
1812;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 2;Human;Female;Hello! Is anyone home? Hello! Is anyone home? Hello...
1813;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;Jeez, no one's coming to the door.
1814;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 2;Human;Female;Let's go check out the yard.
1815;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;Hey, walk on your own.
1816;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'm sorry. It's just that my whole body is aching like crazy. The headquarters was huge, too, but this mansion's something else, huh? Come to think of it, was this place called the "Butterfly Mansion"?
1817;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;Hey, there's someone. Someone's here.
1818;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 2;Human;Female;That would be, um... Oh, right! The Tsuguko... Her name is...
1819;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Tsuguko?
1820;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;It's Master Kanao Tsuyuri.
1821;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Tanjiro;Human;Male;It's the girl from Final Selection.
1822;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;Hey, somebody's forgotten how they got stomped on by Master Kanao last night. A Tsuguko is a swordsman trained by a Hashira. Only the ones with mind-blowing skills and talent get chosen. She's a girl, but she's awesome!
1823;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 2;Human;Female;Please forgive us, Master Tsuyuri. We were ordered to come here by Master Kocho. Permission to enter the mansion? Uh, do you mind? You don't mind, do you?
1824;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Aoi Kanzaki;Human;Female;And who are you?
1825;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;- Uh...
1826;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 2;Human;Female;- We were ordered by Master Kocho!
1827;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Aoi Kanzaki;Human;Female;Are you a Kakushi? You've brought an injured person, right? Please come this way.
1828;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 2;Human;Female;Uh, right!
1829;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;She's fast!
1830;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Five times? I gotta take this five times? A day? And I have to keep taking this medicine for three months? If I take this, I can't eat anything, you know! I mean it's really bitter! It's such an ordeal! So, you mean my arms and legs will heal just by taking medicine? For real? Listen, are they really gonna heal? Tell me how they're gonna get healed!
1831;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kiyo Terauchi;Human;Female;Please stop shouting, will you?
1832;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Somebody explain this to me better!
1833;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Aoi Kanzaki;Human;Female;So, that guy is still making a commotion.
1834;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Zenitsu;Human;Male;What's gonna happen if I forget to take it even once? Hey! Listen! My arms and legs! What's gonna happen to my arms and legs? Hey! What's gonna happen if I forget to take it? Hey! Hey! Hey!
1835;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Zenitsu!
1836;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Aoi Kanzaki;Human;Female;Please try to be quiet! Didn't we already explain it to you numerous times? If you don't stop this nonsense now, we'll tie you up! Really now!
1837;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Zenitsu! Are you okay? Did you hurt yourself? So you did come up the mountain after all!
1838;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Zenitsu;Human;Male;T-Tanjiro... Tanjiro! Listen to me, will you? I got stung by this stinky spider, and the poison hurt like crazy, okay? And that girl's been yelling at me all this time! I hate my life!
1839;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;Hey, get away from me. I've got nothing to do with this.
1840;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Zenitsu, did you get smaller or something?
1841;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Zenitsu;Human;Male;I almost got turned into a spider. My arms and legs are really short right now.
1842;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Is that right? Where's Inosuke? Have you seen Murata?
1843;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Zenitsu;Human;Male;I don't know about anyone named Murata, but Inosuke's right next to me.
1844;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Hey, you're right! He's been here all this time! And I didn't notice! Inosuke, I'm so glad you're all right! I'm so glad you're all right! I'm so sorry! I couldn't rescue you!
1845;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Inosuke;Human;Male;It's okay. Don't worry about it.
1846;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;Paper! Paper! Do something about this!
1847;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Your voice... Is that you, Inosuke?
1848;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kakushi 1;Human;Male;Wipe it! Hey! Do you hear me? Hey!
1849;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Zenitsu;Human;Male;I heard he lost his voice or something. I don't have all the details, but I heard he, like, got hit in the neck, and when he yelled at the top of his lungs at the end, that finished it off. And it did a number on his throat. He's depressed now, so it's made him gentle, and it really cracks me up!
1850;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Why are you cackling in that creepy way all of a sudden? What's going on?
1851;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Inosuke;Human;Male;I'm sorry for being so weak.
1852;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Hang in there, Inosuke! It's not like you to get depressed!
1853;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Come on, you did good! You're awesome!
1854;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'm just so happy that you're alive!
1855;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Did I take my morning meds? Did you see me take them? Somebody? Did you see? Somebody? Did you see?
1856;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Zenitsu... Inosuke... Thank goodness. You're alive. It's all right now. They said you could use this room, Nezuko. Ouch, ouch, ouch! I really got roughed up on Mt. Natagumo. It hurts a lot. To be honest, it hurts like crazy. Nezuko... Thanks for protecting me on the mountain. Who would've guessed that not only you, but Mr. Urokodaki and Mr. Tomioka, as well... They're all risking their lives for us. They're all taking care of us. I need to... become stronger. Even today... The Master more or less saved both your life and mine. That man's voice... It was so soothing in a mysterious way. Just listening to him speak made my head feel light. I wonder what kind of person he is. Oh, right. You're sleep-deprived, aren't you? I'm hurting, and this is tough, but I gotta keep on fighting. Because... I'll be a grown man one day. And then, I'll become an old guy and die. And then, the demon Nezuko will end up all alone. That would be too lonely, wouldn't it, Nezuko? I promise you I'll turn you back into a human, okay?
1857;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Master Ubuyashiki;Human;Male;Just as you've all reported, the demons' carnage has increased more than ever. Meaning that the threat to human life is greater than it's ever been. We'll have to bolster the ranks of the Demon Slayers. What do you all think?
1858;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Sanemi Shinazugawa;Human;Male;The incident on Mt. Natagumo made it crystal clear. The caliber of Demon Slayers has nose-dived to unbelievable levels. Most of them are useless. The trainers must be blind. You'd think they could at least tell if someone's competent or not.
1859;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Tengen Uzui;Human;Male;Well, that kid today sure seemed competent. He did land that flamboyant blow on you, Shinazugawa. He's got potential.
1860;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;The more the human population increases, the harder it becomes to control and unify them. Not to mention that the times have changed considerably in this era.
1861;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Gyomei Himejima;Human;Male;Other than those who've had their loved ones brutally massacred, and joined the Corps, or those of distinguished pedigree who have hunted demons for generations, to ask anyone to harness as much or even greater resolve and drive to produce results would be cruel.
1862;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Kyojuro Rengoku;Human;Male;Still, considering that boy ran into a Twelve Kizuki so soon after joining the Corps... He may have the power to draw them! Even we rarely get the chance to confront one! It makes me envious!
1863;1;23;Hashira Meeting;Master Ubuyashiki;Human;Male;Agreed. But the fact that Lower Five made such a drastic move probably means that Muzan is nowhere near Mt. Natagumo. After all, as in the case of Asakusa, whenever Muzan wishes to hide something, he creates a clever diversion to throw us off. It's really quite frustrating. But those demons are still freely devouring humans, gaining strength and surviving. For the sake of those who have died, there is only one thing for us to do. I believe that among you Hashiras who are present today, I've assembled the finest unit since the First Breathing swordsmen of the feudal era. Tengen Uzui. Kyojuro Rengoku. Shinobu Kocho. Mitsuri Kanroji. Muichiro Tokito. Gyomei Himejima. Sanemi Shinazugawa. Obanai Iguro. Giyu Tomioka. My children, I look forward to your success. Muzan Kibutsuji, I swear I'll defeat you if it's the last thing that I do. We will bring you down without fail.
1864;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Are you heading into battle?
1865;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Kyojuro Rengoku;Human;Male;Is that you, Kocho? We just got some new information about a demon, and the Slayers who confronted him got taken out. We're losing rank and filers, too, now. We can't stand by and do nothing!
1866;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Could it be the Twelve Kizuki?
1867;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Kyojuro Rengoku;Human;Male;Most likely, yes. It might be a member of the Upper Ranks.
1868;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;It sounds like a difficult mission, but as long as you're going, Rengoku, there's nothing to worry about.
1869;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Kyojuro Rengoku;Human;Male;Kocho, what's your plan taking in that head-butting kid? You said you were going to add more Tsuguko, but I'm sure that's not the reason.
1870;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Don't worry, it's not as if I'll gobble him up, all right?
1871;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Kyojuro Rengoku;Human;Male;Well, of course you wouldn't!
1872;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Be careful.
1873;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Nooooo! I can't possibly take any more!
1874;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Aoi Kanzaki;Human;Female;We go through this every single day! You're the most severely injured, Zenitsu! Take your medicine this second! Seriously! Tanjiro, your medicine is right over there.
1875;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Kiyo Terauchi;Human;Female;Here you go.
1876;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Thanks.
1877;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Hey! Tanjiro's medicine goes down easy, doesn't it? Right? It's different than mine, isn't it? I call favoritism! I call favoritism!
1878;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Zenitsu, this is a hospital ward! Pipe down!
1879;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Murata;Human;Male;You seem to be doing well!
1880;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Murata!
1881;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Murata;Human;Male;Hey!
1882;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Are you all right?
1883;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Murata;Human;Male;Well, I came this close to getting melted away, but I made it somehow. But I hear you guys got really banged up.
1884;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;It looks like it's going to take some time.
1885;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Murata;Human;Male;And Wild Boar Kid, in your case, was it the throat? What's the matter with him?
1886;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;He went through a lot. If you could please let him be...
1887;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Murata;Human;Male;But for this guy of all people to be so listlessâ€”
1888;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Tanjiro! Who is that person?
1889;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;He's Murata. He fought with us on Mt. Natagumo.
1890;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Murata;Human;Male;I'm Murata! Nice to meet you! Hey, your arm...
1891;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Zenitsu;Human;Male;I almost got turned into a spider, and my arms and legs are still short...
1892;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Aoi Kanzaki;Human;Female;And that's why you need this medicine!
1893;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Zenitsu;Human;Male;But it tastes so gross! There's only so much gross a person can take!
1894;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Aoi Kanzaki;Human;Female;Don't come crying to me if your arms don't go back to normal!
1895;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Zenitsu;Human;Male;So cold! That's such a cold thing to say!
1896;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Aoi Kanzaki;Human;Female;You don't know how good you have it! I mean, if you take this medicine and get lots of sunlight, there'll be no lasting effects!
1897;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Zenitsu;Human;Male;I can't do it! Gross is gross! No two ways about it!
1898;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Murata;Human;Male;Looks like fun. Lucky you.
1899;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Murata?
1900;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Murata;Human;Male;I was summoned to the Hashira Meeting to give my report on the Mt. Natagumo incident. And it was like hell! Those Hashira are way too terrifying! All pissed about how the quality of the newer Slayers has gone downhill... Because there were some of us who didn't follow orders on Mt. Natagumo. And they were like, "Who trained them?" What good would it do to ask someone of my rank anyway? Hashira terrify me!
1901;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Hello!
1902;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Murata;Human;Male;Hashira! Lady Kocho!
1903;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Hello!
1904;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Murata;Human;Male;Oh hello! Goodbye!
1905;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Oh my! Goodbye! How is your recovery coming along?
1906;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I think we're a lot better now.
1907;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Then, let's have you start your Rehabilitation Training, shall we?
1908;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Rehabilitation Training?
1909;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Yes!
1910;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Inosuke;Human;Male;Forgive me for being weak.
1911;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Tanjiro and Inosuke were taken away by the Hashira, Lady Kocho, and started something called "Rehabilitation Training." Lady Shinobu's voice is totally unique. I don't think I've ever heard anything like it. It lacks regularity, and it scares me a little. But when she was treating the people who got turned into spiders, she sure seemed like a goddess. No wonder everyone ran to Lady Shinobu in tears. Not only that, but she's unbelievably cute! I bet she could make a living on her looks alone. So, this cute lady has taken Tanjiro and Inosuke to Rehabilitation Training to rebuild their stamina. And any minute now... ...they'll be back in this kind of state. Welcome back, Tanjiro, Inosuke! How did it go today? What happened? What's the matter? Hey...
1912;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Sorry.
1913;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Inosuke;Human;Male;Don't mind us.
1914;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Zenitsu;Human;Male;You gotta tell me about it! Because I'll be joining you a little late starting tomorrow! Nooooo! Scary! Scary! Scary! I don't wanna go!
1915;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Aoi Kanzaki;Human;Female;All right, since you'll be joining us from today, Zenitsu, I'll explain the process again now. You'll start over there. Those girls will make your bodies limber again after having been bed-ridden for so long. Next, reflex training. These cups contain medicated water. The objective is to throw that medicated water onto each other, but if your opponent blocks your cup before you can pick it up, you can't move that cup. Now! Again! Now! That's it! Last up, full-body training. In simpler terms, you'll be playing tag. You'll be up against myself, Aoi and Kanao over there.
1916;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Excuse me. May I ask you something?
1917;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Aoi Kanzaki;Human;Female;Is there something that's not clear to you?
1918;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Zenitsu;Human;Male;No, it's just... Come on, both of you.
1919;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Inosuke;Human;Male;Not going.
1920;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Just shut up and come with me like I said! Come on! Come on, dammit! You lowlifes! You dirtbags!
1921;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Inosuke;Human;Male;What the hell are you doing?
1922;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Sit up straight! I said sit up straight! You miserable bastards!
1923;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Inosuke;Human;Male;What did you say?
1924;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Inosuke! What were you thinking, Zenitsu? Tell Inosuke you're sorry!
1925;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Zenitsu;Human;Male;You guys say you're sorry! Apologize to me! How dare you act like you'd come back from Hell when you were in Heaven! All you did was frolic with girls all day, so why did you look so haggard? Get down on your hands and knees and apologize! Commit seppuku!
1926;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;How can you say such a thing?
1927;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Shut up, you goody-goody, talking forehead! Just shut up and listen, got that? You're allowed to touch girls! You get to have your bodies massaged! When you play that cup game, you get to touch their hands! When you play tag, you get to touch their whole freakin' bodies! Each girl has two boobs, one behind and two thighs! They smell so nice when they pass by, and it's mad fun just to look at them! Heaven! Sheer heaven!
1928;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Inosuke;Human;Male;Cut the crap! You're not making any sense! When you lose to someone smaller than you, it destroys your soul!
1929;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Oh, poor you! Inosuke, you've never been chummy with a girl before, right? Right, you were raised in the mountains! No wonder you're a late bloomer! I feel so sorry for you!
1930;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Inosuke;Human;Male;Snap! Oh please, I've stomped on female kids before!
1931;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Zenitsu;Human;Male;That's the worst thing you could do! Not good, no good! That's not gonna get you any girls!
1932;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Inosuke;Human;Male;I can get as many girls as I want!
1933;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Please train me well! It's all good! All good!
1934;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Inosuke;Human;Male;That guy has what it takes. I'm always fighting back tears from the pain, but he's laughing.
1935;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Aoi Kanzaki;Human;Female;I shall take you on.
1936;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Naho Takada;Human;Female;Begin!
1937;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Zenitsu;Human;Male;I would never splash tea on a girl.
1938;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Naho Takada;Human;Female;Now then, full-body training! Begin!
1939;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Zenitsu;Human;Male;I win! I won the battle but lost the war!
1940;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Inosuke;Human;Male;I'm gonna kick some butt, too! All right! All right!
1941;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Aoi Kanzaki;Human;Female;Ouch!
1942;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'm the only one on a losing streak and soaked. So embarrassing! But... I just can't beat Kanao. None of us can get to her cup before her or grab it away from her. For the next five days, I continued to lose to Kanao. So did Inosuke... and Zenitsu. We couldn't so much as lay a finger on a strand of her hair. And then one day, the other two stopped coming to the training room. Z-Zenitsu? Inosuke? Please train me! Thank you for a good workout. Why can't I beat her? What gives her the edge over me? First of all, her reflexes are way faster. Even if I were 100 percent, I'd probably lose to her. Her scent is totally different. It's similar to the scent of the Hashira.
1943;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Sumi Nakahara;Human;Female;Master Tanjiro?
1944;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Also... her eyes? Her eyes are different!
1945;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Sumi Nakahara;Human;Female;Master Tanjiro?
1946;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;It seems.
1947;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Sumi Nakahara;Human;Female;Um... Master Tanjiro, are you all right? We've been calling to you over and over.
1948;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Sorry! I didn't hear you. What's up?
1949;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Sumi Nakahara;Human;Female;Here's a towel for you.
1950;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Thanks! That's a big help! You're all so kind!
1951;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Kiyo Terauchi;Human;Female;Um, Master Tanjiro, do you maintain the Total Concentration Breathing state around the clock? Morning, noon and night. And all through the night while you're asleep. Do you use the Total Concentration Breathing technique nonstop?
1952;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;No, I don't. I've never done that. Is that even possible?
1953;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Kiyo Terauchi;Human;Female;Yes! We're told that being able to do that makes all the difference in the world!
1954;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Even just using that technique for a short time really takes it toll on me, but I should do it around the clock, huh?
1955;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Naho Takada;Human;Female;Some people have already mastered it.
1956;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Sumi Nakahara;Human;Female;All of the Hashira and Miss Kanao!
1957;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Kiyo Terauchi;Human;Female;Please work hard at it!
1958;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I see! Thanks! I'll give it a try! Isn't it about time you came to training, Inosuke? Sulking and feeling sorry for yourself won't do you any good. Zenitsu, you should come, too!
1959;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Yes! For me, that was a good job! Just tell them my injury's taken a turn for the worse! Hey, Kakushi lady over there! Would you like to have some tea with me?
1960;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Total Concentration Breathing... Morning, noon and night. Even while I'm asleep. I said I'd try to keep it up around the clock. But I can't do it at all! I can't do it! If I try to do Total Concentration Breathing longer, it makes me feel like I'm gonna die! It's too painful! My lungs hurt! My ears hurt! My ears are ringing like crazy! My eardrums! That scared the heck out of me! For a second there, I thought my heart had burst through my ears! I'll never make it at this rate! When you're in trouble, go back to basics! You spineless fool! Breathing is all about the lungs. If I can't get the hang of it, that means my lungs are too weak. Work at it! All I can do is work hard! That's the story of my life! Hard work is the sum of daily efforts! It can be one step at a time! Move forward! Right!
1961;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Kiyo Terauchi;Human;Female;Master Tanjiro is working hard every day!
1962;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Sumi Nakahara;Human;Female;Yes! Let's bring him some rice balls, okay?
1963;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Naho Takada;Human;Female;Good idea! And also...
1964;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Blow into these gourds?
1965;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Kiyo Terauchi;Human;Female;That's right. Whenever she trained Lady Kanao, Lady Shinobu often had her blow into gourds.
1966;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Oh, really? That's a neat training technique, huh? So, you make some kind of sound?
1967;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Kiyo Terauchi;Human;Female;Oh no. She blew into it to make the gourd explode.
1968;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Oh, really? Explode? What? You mean this? Something this hard?
1969;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Kiyo Terauchi;Human;Female;Yes! Not to mention, this is a special kind of gourd, so it's harder than normal ones.
1970;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;A girl that petite was able to do that to something that hard?
1971;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Kiyo Terauchi;Human;Female;The gourds get bigger and bigger as you progress. The one that Lady Kanao can explode right now... is this gourd.
1972;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Gigantic! I'll give it my all!
1973;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Aoi Kanzaki;Human;Female;They're not coming today, either?
1974;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'm sorry. I'll bring them tomorrow. I'm sorry.
1975;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Aoi Kanzaki;Human;Female;No. You don't have to concern yourself with those two anymore!
1976;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'll work hard. I'll work hard! While throwing myself into the drills that Mr. Urokodaki pounded into me, I'm also maintaining my Total Concentration Breathing state. Imagining I'm running down a mountain, I race all around the mansion's garden! All of the obstacles are stand-ins for the trees on that mountain! Hard work! Hard work! Hard work! Hard work! I've regained most of my stamina. And now, I can run farther than I did before, and my lungs are getting stronger! I'm making good progress! During the day, I run all over the place and put my lungs into overdrive with swift moves. So now, I'll breathe slow. I'll take slow, deep breaths and send air all the way to my fingertips. Meditation boosts concentration. Mr. Urokodaki said so himself. Mr. Urokodaki...
1977;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Haganezuka;Human;Male;How dare you break my sword!
1978;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Please forgive me. They're reforging my sword for me now, but I'm really, really sorry. Concentrate! You need to concentrate! Concentrate on your breathing!
1979;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!
1980;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yes?
1981;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;I can see you're working very hard. Even though your friends went off somewhere... Don't you feel lonely all by yourself?
1982;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;No! Because once I've mastered it myself, I can teach them, too!
1983;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;You have a beautiful soul, don't you?
1984;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Um... Why did you bring us all here?
1985;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Nezuko's existence has been officially acknowledged, and the three of you were injured so seriously. And also, I'd like to entrust my dream to you.
1986;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Dream?
1987;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Yes. My dream that we can become friends with the demons. I'm quite sure you can accomplish that!
1988;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Are you angry? For some reason, I'm always picking up an angry scent from you even though you're always smiling.
1989;1;24;Rehabilitation Training;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Yes. You're right. It might be true that I'm in a constant state of anger. Ever since my beloved big sister was slaughtered by a demon. Every time I see the tears of those who've lost their loved ones to a demon, every time I hear those cries of despair, the anger keeps building up inside me and continues to swell. Deep down in the innermost depths of my body, there's a revulsion that I can't fight. I'm sure the other Hashira feel something similar, as well. Well, this time, they saw Nezuko, who's never devoured a human, with their own eyes, and they've memorized her presence. Out of respect for the Master's wishes, I don't think anyone will raise a hand to her. My big sister was a kind-hearted person like you. She had sympathy for demons. Even when she was on the brink of death, she still felt pity for them. I couldn't bring myself to feel that way. How can you feel sorry for something that's killed humans? I've never heard of anything so absurd. But if that was how my sister truly felt, then I must carry it on. If there's a way not to kill these pitiful demons, I have to keep trying to come up with it. Without ever extinguishing the smile that my sister said she loved... Sister! Sister! Sister! But now, I'm a bit exhausted. Demons do nothing but lie. Losing all reason out of self-preservation, they murder humans with their instincts laid totally bare. Tanjiro, please do all that you can. Please find a way to protect Nezuko until the end. Knowing that you're working so hard in my place reassures me to no end. I can rest easy now. Your Total Concentration Breathing has come to a halt.
1990;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Naho! Kiyo! Sumi! I'd like you to help me train. If I stop doing Total Concentration Breathing while I'm asleep, can you clobber me with these carpet beaters? Please help me!
1991;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Naho Sumi & Kiyo Together;Human;Female;Very well!
1992;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Thank you!
1993;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Naho Takada;Human;Female;It's all good, right?
1994;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Kiyo Terauchi;Human;Female;Master Tanjiro's doing a good job!
1995;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Sumi Nakahara;Human;Female;Yes!
1996;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Spineless fool... Please let me try again!
1997;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Naho Sumi & Kiyo Together;Human;Female;Okay!
1998;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;If you please!
1999;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Naho Sumi & Kiyo Together;Human;Female;Give it all you've got!
2000;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;This time, for sure! One more time please!
2001;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Aoi Kanzaki;Human;Female;Just you again today, Tanjiro?
2002;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'm sorry! I did ask them to come, but...
2003;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Aoi Kanzaki;Human;Female;Well, it doesn't matter to me.
2004;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'll give them another nudge later! I'm starting to get used to training while doing Total Concentration Breathing! Although I can't sustain it all day unless I really get myself pumped up,
2005;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Naho Sumi & Kiyo Together;Human;Female;497! 498! 499! 500! 501!
2006;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;the longer that I can keep doing Total Concentration Breathing, the bigger the stamina boost I get!
2007;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Naho Sumi & Kiyo Together;Human;Female;You can do it!
2008;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Hey, I can chase after her! I'm able to chase right after that girl! I can keep up with her! Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch! Thank you very much! Zenitsu! Inosuke!
2009;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Aoi Kanzaki;Human;Female;I refuse to get involved!
2010;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Naho Sumi & Kiyo Together;Human;Female;You can do it! You can do it! You can do it!
2011;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;It broke!
2012;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Naho Takada;Human;Female;Now all you have to break is this huge gourd!
2013;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yeah! I did it! Thanks, all of you!
2014;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Oh, crap. So, Tanjiro's already gone off to train. Jeez, it's the crack of dawn. Putting in effort isn't my thing. There's nothing more draining than persevering every day. Oh, it's you. Maybe getting left behind by Tanjiro is making me panic, but I can't get the hang of anything even if he shows me for hours! Now I realize that we're a total lost cause. Wait, did you just say, Yes, you are? How can you be so cruel? Would it kill you to say just once, You're working hard, too? Did you just say, "Work harder"? I guess there's no way out of it. Gross!
2015;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Inosuke;Human;Male;Come on, Monitsu.
2016;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;What Tanjiro is trying to master is a skill called "Total Concentration, Constant." By continuing to do Total Concentration Breathing every second of the day, your basic stamina level will skyrocket. Let's just go ahead and try it!
2017;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Impossible! Seriously impossible!
2018;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I still can't sustain Total Concentration Breathing all day unless I really throw myself into it, but I bet you two can do it! You go like this to make your lungs expand! When that rattles your blood, your bones and muscles will go, "Boom! Boom!" You gotta stop it! All that's left to do is train like crazy!
2019;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Now, now... We're talking about a basic skill, or should I say a beginner's skill, so why wouldn't you be able to do it? But it's also true that one must put great effort into mastering it, right? Well, why wouldn't you be able to do it, though? I was sure it would be child's play for you, Inosuke. Are you sure you can't do it? Even though there's no reason you can't do it? It can't be helped, then, if you can't do it. Can't be helped! Can't be helped!
2020;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Inosuke;Human;Male;I can do it, all right! Why wouldn't I? Don't mess with me, or I swear I'll rip off your breasts!
2021;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Please give it your all, Zenitsu! I'm your biggest cheerleader!
2022;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Yes, ma'am!
2023;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Kanao, you're in the same class, so why don't you join them?
2024;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;More! More! Boom! Boom! Boom!
2025;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Inosuke;Human;Male;You damn wimp!
2026;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;You got this, Zenitsu!
2027;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Kanao Tsuyuri;Human;Female;It hurts. I'm hungry. I'm sad. I feel hopeless. I'm in agony. I'm lonely. That was my life. But then, one day, I heard a sound like a snap. And I never knew pain again. I never knew pain again. While living in poverty, even when my parents sold me, it didn't make me feel sad.
2028;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Kanae Kocho;Human;Female;Excuse me, do you have a minute? Could you tell us why that child is all tied up? Is she a criminal, perhaps?
2029;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Young Kanao's Owner;Human;Male;Isn't it obvious? She's flea-ridden, and her face is dirty. Not to mention, she might try to escape.
2030;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Kanae Kocho;Human;Female;Hello, there. Nice to meet you. My name is Kanae Kocho. What's your name?
2031;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Young Kanao's Owner;Human;Male;She's got no name, all right? Her parents never gave her one. Happy now? Get away from her!
2032;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Please don't touch my sister.
2033;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Young Kanao's Owner;Human;Male;What's your problem, you two? If you wanna talk to this kid, pay up!
2034;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;All right, then, we'll purchase her. Would this be enough?
2035;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Young Kanao's Owner;Human;Male;Hey! Come back here, dammit!
2036;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;I'd pick it up right now if I were you! After all, there's a crowd here, and the wind is strong!
2037;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Kanae Kocho;Human;Female;Are you sure about this?
2038;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;It's fine!
2039;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Kanae Kocho;Human;Female;Please excuse us!
2040;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Young Kanao's Owner;Human;Male;Hands off! It's my property!
2041;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Kanae Kocho;Human;Female;Oh my. Oh my.
2042;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Sister! Sister! Sister, this child is hopeless! She can't do anything without being told! That goes for meals, as well! She won't touch her food unless I tell her to eat! Even as her stomach growls and growls!
2043;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Kanae Kocho;Human;Female;Oh my. Oh my.
2044;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;What exactly are we going to do with her?
2045;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Kanae Kocho;Human;Female;Now, now, don't be like that, okay? I just love that smile of yours, Shinobu.
2046;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;But we can't do anything with a kid who can't even think for herself! It's dangerous!
2047;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Kanae Kocho;Human;Female;Well, you do have a point, but...
2048;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;She can't do anything on her own! She can't decide for herself!
2049;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Kanae Kocho;Human;Female;All right, when you're on your own, you can decide by flipping this coin. Right, Kanao?
2050;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Sister!
2051;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Kanae Kocho;Human;Female;You don't have to take this so seriously, you know... since Kanao is so adorable!
2052;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;That's not a good reason!
2053;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Kanae Kocho;Human;Female;As long as it's given a chance, a person's soul will open up, so don't worry. When you fall in love with some boy someday, you'll change, too, Kanao.
2054;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;You're doing great! Keep it up! Right now! Harder! Bam! That's it! You can do it, Zenitsu! You've got this! Looking good! Inosuke! Inosuke! They'll be bringing our reforged Nichirin Swords soon!
2055;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Inosuke;Human;Male;For real?
2056;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yeah! I just heard it from the crow! That's Mr. Haganezuka's scent!
2057;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Inosuke;Human;Male;Yahoo!
2058;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Let's go! Let's go!
2059;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Inosuke;Human;Male;Yahoo!
2060;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Mr. Haganezuka! Hey! Hey! Mr. Haganezuka! Long time no see! How have you been? M-Mr. Haganezuka?
2061;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Haganezuka;Human;Male;How dare you snap my sword in two? You've got a lot a nerve!
2062;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'm sorry! B-But to be honest, I came this close to being killed! My opponent was insanely strong!
2063;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Haganezuka;Human;Male;Not true! That has nothing to do with it! You're the one to blame! It's all your fault! You're pitifully weak! That's why it broke! Otherwise, my sword would never snap like that!
2064;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;But...
2065;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Haganezuka;Human;Male;I'm going to kill you!
2066;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Is that a new training regimen?
2067;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Aoi Kanzaki;Human;Female;Probably not.
2068;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Kanamori;Human;Male;Well, Mr. Haganezuka is a very passionate man.
2069;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yes.
2070;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Kanamori;Human;Male;He loves his swords more than anyone. There's no one like him even in the sword-forgers' homeland.
2071;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;You're probably right.
2072;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Kanamori;Human;Male;My name is Kanamori. I was the one who forged Master Inosuke's swords. I would be thrilled if they prove useful in battle. Beautiful, aren't they? The dull sheen of that indigo-gray hue is so cool. It's a fine color for a sword.
2073;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'm happy for you, Inosuke, since your sword was chipped all over.
2074;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Kanamori;Human;Male;How do you like the grips? The thing is, this is the first time I've ever forged swords for a dual-wielder. Master Inosuke?
2075;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Inosuke;Human;Male;Better.
2076;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Kanamori;Human;Male;I'll kill you, you miserable brat! You bastard! Are you flaunting it?
2077;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;We're sorry! We're sorry!
2078;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Kanamori;Human;Male;Bastard! That's it! You're a dead man! Unbelievable! He's unbelievable!
2079;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;We're sorry! We're sorry!
2080;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Haganezuka;Human;Male;Taking a stone to those swords?
2081;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Kanamori;Human;Male;Unbelievable!
2082;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;We're sorry! We're sorry! We're sorry!
2083;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Naho Takada;Human;Female;Looks like he'll be fine.
2084;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Sumi Nakahara;Human;Female;After all, Master Tanjiro was really giving it his all!
2085;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Kiyo Terauchi;Human;Female;Let's make him some rice balls again! Yeah!
2086;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;My body's changed! I can't wait to swing my sword! With these hands! My Nichirin Sword! I did it!
2087;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Sumi Nakahara;Human;Female;Good move! You can do it!
2088;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Don't let up for a second! You can do it! I did it! Go! This medicated water stinks. It would be cruel to splash her with it.
2089;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Sumi Nakahara;Human;Female;- He won!
2090;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Kiyo Terauchi;Human;Female;- Does that count as winning?
2091;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Naho Takada;Human;Female;Either way, it's the same thing!
2092;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yeah! I did it! I did it!
2093;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Inosuke;Human;Male;- Oh, crap.
2094;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Zenitsu;Human;Male;- Oh, crap.
2095;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;All right! Open up! Okay! Looks like your jaw is as good as new. All right, you can close your mouth now. That concludes this exam. Since you're physically sound now, you may take on your missions without any misgivings.
2096;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;So, I'm done with my training?
2097;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Yes. All that's left for you now is actual combat.
2098;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Right! Oh, before I forget, Lady Shinobu... There's something I wanted to ask you.
2099;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;What would that be?
2100;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Have you ever heard of the Hinokami Kagura Dance?
2101;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;I have not.
2102;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Uh, w-well then, how about Fire Breathing?
2103;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Never heard of it.
2104;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;A-Actually, this is something that happened during my childhood.
2105;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Yes, yes. I see. So, for some reason, Tanjiro, your father used Fire Breathing. All I can tell you is that while Flame Breathing does exist, it's not Fire Breathing.
2106;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;What? They're not the same thing?
2107;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;I'm not familiar with the details myself. Please forgive me. But I do know that they're very strict about the exact phrasing. Flame Breathing must never be referred to as "Fire Breathing." The Flame Hashira, Rengoku, might know something about this, but unfortunately, he's out on a mission.
2108;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Understood! Thank you for all that you've taught me. I'll ask Mr. Rengoku if I ever get a chance to see him again.
2109;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Right.
2110;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Now then, please excuse me!
2111;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Kamado?
2112;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yes?
2113;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;I'm expecting great things of you.
2114;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Right! She's asleep all day again today. I know they said you could be sleeping to recover your stamina, but it does worry me if you don't open your eyes once in a while. Hey, I'll probably be leaving this place soon to go on my next mission. I've healed physically, and I've gotten a little stronger, too. And I'm still doing Total Concentration, Constant right now. I think Zenitsu and Inosuke will be with me, too. Having those two by my side gives me confidence. I see. You think so, too, Nezuko? They're both good guys. To turn you back into a human, I gotta bring down the strongest demons that I can, and send Miss Tamayo their blood samples. Am I capable of doing that?
2115;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Nezuko;Demon;Female;I know you can do it, Big Brother.
2116;1;25;Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Thanks, Nezuko. You just encouraged me, didn't you? I'll try my hardest, all right?
2117;1;26;New Mission;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Holy -
2118;1;26;New Mission;Inosuke;Human;Male;Look at them go!
2119;1;26;New Mission;Aoi Kanzaki;Human;Female;That's it!
2120;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;You sure are fast, Kanao!
2121;1;26;New Mission;Aoi Kanzaki;Human;Female;Your record is now ten wins and ten losses.
2122;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I'm totally not done yet. Let's go for a run. Are you up to it?
2123;1;26;New Mission;Zenitsu;Human;Male;You mean while doing\Full Focus, Constant?
2124;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yeah.
2125;1;26;New Mission;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Keep this up the whole time?
2126;1;26;New Mission;Inosuke;Human;Male;Monjirou!
2127;1;26;New Mission;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Take this!
2128;1;26;New Mission;Inosuke;Human;Male;That's nothin'!
2129;1;26;New Mission;Zenitsu;Human;Male;You're all brawn and no brains!
2130;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Let's go!
2131;1;26;New Mission;Kamanue (Lower Moon 6);Demon;Male;Where the hell is this place? Was it that woman's Blood Demon Technique? Looks like the whole space is distorted around that woman. Only the Lower Moons of the Twelve Demon Moons have been summoned. That's never happened before. Lower Moon Five isn't here yet. It just moved! Blood Demon Technique again? What's the deal with this woman? Who is she?
2132;1;26;New Mission;Muzan;Demon;N/a;Lower your heads and crouch down. Prostrate yourselves.
2133;1;26;New Mission;Kamanue (Lower Moon 6);Demon;Male;It's Muzan-sama! That's Muzan-sama's voice! I didn't recognize him! He's changed his appearance and aura. The precision of his shape-shifting is mind-blowing!
2134;1;26;New Mission;Mukago (Lower Moon 4);Demon;Female;P-Please forgive us! Since you've assumed a different form and aura...
2135;1;26;New Mission;Muzan;Demon;N/a;Who gave you permission to speak? Don't presume to voice your worthless thoughts. Answer my questions. Nothing else. Rui was killed. I'm talking about Lower Moon Five. I have but one question to ask of you. Why is it that you demons in the Lower Moons are so utterly weak? You shouldn't be satisfied with just being counted among the Twelve Demon Moons. That is merely your starting point. To devour more humans, to gain more power... Your starting point for becoming useful to me... For over a century, the members of the Upper Moons of the Twelve Demon Moons remain unchanged. It's always been the demons of the Upper Moons who've disposed of those Pillar demon hunters. But what about you demons in the Lower Moons? How many times have you been replaced?
2136;1;26;New Mission;Kamanue (Lower Moon 6);Demon;Male;That's easy for you to say, but we...
2137;1;26;New Mission;Muzan;Demon;N/a;That's easy for you to say, but we... What? Go ahead and say it.
2138;1;26;New Mission;Kamanue (Lower Moon 6);Demon;Male;He can read my mind? I'm screwed!
2139;1;26;New Mission;Muzan;Demon;N/a;Screwed how? Go ahead and say it.
2140;1;26;New Mission;Kamanue (Lower Moon 6);Demon;Male;Please forgive me, Kibutsuji-sama! Please! Please show me mercy! I'm truly sorry! I'm truly sorry! I'm trulyâ€”
2141;1;26;New Mission;Wakuraba (Lower Moon 3);Demon;Male;Why is this happening? Am I going to be killed? After all I went through to become one of the Twelve Demon Moons... Why? Why? I thought I was going to do more and more!
2142;1;26;New Mission;Muzan;Demon;N/a;Are you more afraid of the demon hunters than you are of me?
2143;1;26;New Mission;Mukago (Lower Moon 4);Demon;Female;No!
2144;1;26;New Mission;Muzan;Demon;N/a;Every time you run into a demon hunter Pillar, the only thing on your mind is escape.
2145;1;26;New Mission;Mukago (Lower Moon 4);Demon;Female;Oh no, that's not what I'm thinking! I'll put my own life on the line to fight for you!
2146;1;26;New Mission;Muzan;Demon;N/a;Are you refuting what I just said?
2147;1;26;New Mission;Wakuraba (Lower Moon 3);Demon;Male;No good! It's over! Our minds are being read. Whether we agree or disagree with him, he's still going to kill us! We can't possibly beat him in battle, either! In that case... ...the only option is to run!
2148;1;26;New Mission;Enmu (Lower Moon 1);Demon;Male;What a fool.
2149;1;26;New Mission;Wakuraba (Lower Moon 3);Demon;Male;Just make it out of here somehow! Somehow! Now that I've gotten this far away...
2150;1;26;New Mission;Muzan;Demon;N/a;I believe that the Twelve Demon Moons are better off consisting of just the Upper Moons. I am now dismantling the Lower Moons.
2151;1;26;New Mission;Wakuraba (Lower Moon 3);Demon;Male;He got me? No way! Was it that Biwa Player's technique? But no, I didn't hear any biwa sounds. Why? I can't regenerate my body.
2152;1;26;New Mission;Muzan;Demon;N/a;Do you have any last words?
2153;1;26;New Mission;Rokuro (Lower Moon 2);Demon;Male;I can still be of use to you! If you could give me just a short reprieve, I swear I'll be of use to you!
2154;1;26;New Mission;Muzan;Demon;N/a;How long a reprieve are you asking for, specifically? How do you intend to be useful? What exactly can you accomplish with your current skills?
2155;1;26;New Mission;Rokuro (Lower Moon 2);Demon;Male;Your blood! If you could give me a share of your blood, I will acclimate without fail! I will fight for you as an even more powerful demon!
2156;1;26;New Mission;Muzan;Demon;N/a;What makes you think you can order me to give you my blood? You're beyond shameless. Remember who you are.
2157;1;26;New Mission;Rokuro (Lower Moon 2);Demon;Male;You misunderstood me! You misunderstood me! I just...
2158;1;26;New Mission;Muzan;Demon;N/a;Shut up. I misunderstood nothing. I'm never mistaken about anything. I'm the one who calls all the shots. My word is absolute. You have no right to reject what I say. Whatever I say is right is right . You tried to tell me what to do. You deserve to die. Do you have any last words?
2159;1;26;New Mission;Wakuraba (Lower Moon 3);Demon;Male;He'll end up killed, too. Everything hinges on the Master's mood. I'll be dead soon myself.
2160;1;26;New Mission;Enmu (Lower Moon 1);Demon;Male;Well, let's see... This is like a dream for me. To die by your hand in person. And I so enjoyed hearing the other demons' last gasps! I feel so blessed! Because I love to see others in despair and agony. Because it's like a dream come true for me! I thank you for leaving me for last!
2161;1;26;New Mission;Muzan;Demon;N/a;That's what I like to hear. I'm going to give you an ample share of my blood. Although you might not be able to withstand the volume of blood, and die. Still, if you do manage to acclimate, you're sure to acquire even greater strength. Make yourself useful to me, then. Kill the demon hunter Pillars! If you can kill the demon hunter wearing hanafuda-like earrings, I'll give you even more of my blood.
2162;1;26;New Mission;Enmu (Lower Moon 1);Demon;Male;What's this? I see something! It's gushing into me along with Muzan-sama's blood! If I kill the Pillars and this kid, I can get more blood! It's like a dream!
2163;1;26;New Mission;Crow;Bird;Bird;It's morning! Wake up!
2164;1;26;New Mission;Inosuke;Human;Male;What the heck?
2165;1;26;New Mission;Zenitsu;Human;Male;What's going on?
2166;1;26;New Mission;Crow;Bird;Bird;The casualties of the Infinite Train are increasing. More than 40 are now missing. You are to join Rengoku Kyoujurou on site. Head west at once!
2167;1;26;New Mission;Master Ubuyashiki;Human;Male;I have decided to send Tanjirou and the others on the Infinite Train mission. Shinobu, may I ask what made you recommend Tanjirou?
2168;1;26;New Mission;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Kamado-kun has a pure soul and is capable of striving hard on a daily basis. And the upside that he showed exceeded my expectations. And above all else, he has a clear goal in mind. To defeat Kibutsuji.
2169;1;26;New Mission;Master Ubuyashiki;Human;Male;As far as that goes, I'm in agreement with you.
2170;1;26;New Mission;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;Also, Kamado-kun himself told me that his father had used the Breath of Fire technique.
2171;1;26;New Mission;Master Ubuyashiki;Human;Male;Ah...
2172;1;26;New Mission;Shinobu Kocho;Human;Female;At this time, there's no denying that he still has a way to go, but perhaps Rengoku, the Flame Pillar, might be able to provide some guidance.
2173;1;26;New Mission;Master Ubuyashiki;Human;Male;Yes. Considering his sister, who won't devour humans even after becoming a demon, as well as his encounter with Kibutsuji, it might very well be Tanjirou's destiny.
2174;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;All right, time to go! Someone's coming. He bumped into me even though I got out of the way. Huh? That guy just now... Was he at the Final Selection? He got such an amazing build in such a short time. But I wonder why... His scent... Long time no see! Glad to see you're doing well!
2175;1;26;New Mission;Aoi Kanzaki;Human;Female;Is that right? You're heading out now? It was only for a short time, but I'm glad we got to spend that time together. Good luck to you! Take care!
2176;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Thank you so much for looking out for us when you were so busy! Thanks to you, we can go back into battle!
2177;1;26;New Mission;Aoi Kanzaki;Human;Female;No need to thank me. After all, I survived the Final Selection only by luck. And then, I was too afraid to go into battle. I'm a coward.
2178;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Hey, that doesn't matter. Since you helped me out, Aoi-san, you're part of me now. And I'm carrying all of your emotions onto the battlefield with me! All right! Look after me if I get hurt again, okay? Hey! There you are! Kanao! We're heading out now. Thanks for everything! Hey! What's that?
2179;1;26;New Mission;Kanao Tsuyuri;Human;Female;All I did was follow the Master's orders. There's no need for you to thank me. Farewell.
2180;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;She talked to me! What was that you just flipped?
2181;1;26;New Mission;Kanao Tsuyuri;Human;Female;Farewell.
2182;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Money? It says "Heads" and "Tails," huh? Why did you flip it?
2183;1;26;New Mission;Kanao Tsuyuri;Human;Female;Farewell.
2184;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;You really made it twirl around!
2185;1;26;New Mission;Kanao Tsuyuri;Human;Female;I flip this to decide what I haven't been ordered to do. I just decided whether or not to speak to you. Don't speak was heads, and "Speak" was tails. Because it came up tails, I spoke to you. Farewell.
2186;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Why don't you decide for yourself? What did you want to do, Kanao? It doesn't matter.
2187;1;26;New Mission;Kanao Tsuyuri;Human;Female;Nothing matters to me, so I can't decide for myself.
2188;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;I don't think there's anything in this world that doesn't matter. I guess... the voice in your heart is really tiny. Sure, following orders is important, but... Hey, can I borrow that for a second?
2189;1;26;New Mission;Kanao Tsuyuri;Human;Female;Yes.
2190;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Thanks! Okay! Let's toss this to decide!
2191;1;26;New Mission;Kanao Tsuyuri;Human;Female;Decide what?
2192;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Whether or not... you're going to listen hard to the voice in your own heart from now on! I flipped it too high! Heads! Let's make it heads! If it comes up heads, Kanao, you're going to follow your heart! Huh? Where did it go? Oh, is that it? Got it! Got it! Kanao! Ready, Kanao?
2193;1;26;New Mission;Kanao Tsuyuri;Human;Female;Which is it? His back was blocking it, so I couldn't see it the moment it fell.
2194;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;It's heads! Kanao! Good luck! It's the heart that drives people. So, your heart can grow as strong as you want it to! All right! See you again someday!
2195;1;26;New Mission;Kanao Tsuyuri;Human;Female;H-How did you make it come up heads? I saw his hand when he flipped it. I'm sure he didn't cheat.
2196;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Just by chance. And if it was tails, I was going to keep tossing it over and over until it came up heads! Take care!
2197;1;26;New Mission;Naho Sumi & Kiyo Together;Human;Female;You can do it! You can do it! You can do it! Yay!
2198;1;26;New Mission;Kiyo Terauchi;Human;Female;Here you go.
2199;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Thanks!
2200;1;26;New Mission;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Don't eat it now!
2201;1;26;New Mission;Naho Sumi & Kiyo Together;Human;Female;Please go out and defeat tons of demons!
2202;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;We'll do our best!
2203;1;26;New Mission;Zenitsu;Human;Male;I told you not to eat it now!
2204;1;26;New Mission;Inosuke;Human;Male;Shut up!
2205;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Tomioka-san!
2206;1;26;New Mission;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;Are you heading into battle now?
2207;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yes!
2208;1;26;New Mission;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;I hear that you've mastered Full Focus, Constant.
2209;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yes!
2210;1;26;New Mission;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;You should keep at it.
2211;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Yes. Tomioka-san... About Nezuko... Thank you very much. I had no idea you were putting your life on the line. I just don't know how I can ever thank you.
2212;1;26;New Mission;Giyu Tomioka;Human;Male;You can thank me by doing good work. Our mission as Demon Slayers is to kill demons. That's all.
2213;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Right!
2214;1;26;New Mission;Kiyo Terauchi;Human;Female;Take care, you guys!
2215;1;26;New Mission;Zenitsu;Human;Male;You're all heartbroken to say goodbye to me, aren't you? I can stay behind if you want!
2216;1;26;New Mission;Kiyo Terauchi;Human;Female;Zenitsu-san, please try to learn how to be considerate and respectful of girls.
2217;1;26;New Mission;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Right.
2218;1;26;New Mission;Inosuke;Human;Male;I'm feeling giddy.
2219;1;26;New Mission;Zenitsu;Human;Male;But you do feel a little sad that I'm leaving, don't you?
2220;1;26;New Mission;Naho Sumi & Kiyo Together;Human;Female;We are not sad!
2221;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Okay! You guys! We're heading out now!
2222;1;26;New Mission;Inosuke;Human;Male;Hey... Hey! Hey! Wha... Wh-What... What the hell is this creature? I bet this is that thing! The master of this land! The ruler of this land! See how long it is? So intimidating! No mistake! It looks like it's asleep right now, but don't let your guard down!
2223;1;26;New Mission;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Uh, no, it's a train. Haven't you ever seen one before?
2224;1;26;New Mission;Inosuke;Human;Male;Shush! Calm down! I'll lead the charge!
2225;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Hold up, Inosuke! You never know, it might be the guardian spirit of this land. Also, you shouldn't attack all of a sudden.
2226;1;26;New Mission;Zenitsu;Human;Male;No, didn't you hear me? It's a train. A railway train, all right? It's a vehicle for transporting people. You country bumpkin!
2227;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;A train? So, is that what the crow was talking about?
2228;1;26;New Mission;Zenitsu;Human;Male;What's his problem?
2229;1;26;New Mission;Inosuke;Human;Male;Pig assault!
2230;1;26;New Mission;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Stop it! Talk about embarrassing!
2231;1;26;New Mission;Guard;Human;Male;What are you doing? Hey, you! Hey, these guys have swords! The police! Call the police!
2232;1;26;New Mission;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Oh, crap! Crap, crap, crap! Run! Thanks to you, we went through hell, Inosuke! Say you're sorry!
2233;1;26;New Mission;Inosuke;Human;Male;In the first place, why did we have to run from the police?
2234;1;26;New Mission;Zenitsu;Human;Male;We the Demon Slayers aren't officially recognized by the government! We can't really walk around in broad daylight with our swords. They wouldn't believe us even if we explained about the demons, and it would only confuse them.
2235;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Even though we're working so hard?
2236;1;26;New Mission;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Well, it can't be helped. For now, let's hide our swords on our backs. You can totally see them. Put on some clothes, idiot. Oh, crap! The train's leaving! Are the police still around?
2237;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;We'll have to go even if they are.
2238;1;26;New Mission;Inosuke;Human;Male;I'm taking you on! Master of this land!
2239;1;26;New Mission;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Hey, idiot!
2240;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;We should go, too!
2241;1;26;New Mission;Guard;Human;Male;Hey! You three!
2242;1;26;New Mission;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Tanjirou! Inosuke!
2243;1;26;New Mission;Tanjiro;Human;Male;Zenitsu!
2244;1;26;New Mission;Inosuke;Human;Male;Man, it's fast!
2245;1;26;New Mission;Zenitsu;Human;Male;Tanjirou... Are you sure about bringing Nezuko along? Wouldn't the Demon Slayer Corps Headquarters be the safest place for her?
